GUN PRACTICE IN THE FRENCH NAVY.</h2>

<p>The gunners of the French fleet are possessed of a
skill which is recognized by all the maritime powers,
and these picked men proved this at the siege of Paris,
where they made themselves illustrious, not only by
their courage and their coolness, but also by the accuracy
of their firing.</p>

<p>Nothing is neglected, moreover, to keep up the precision
of hand and eye that distinguishes them, and which
has become so much the more necessary in that it is no
longer a question of firing a broadside at the enemy and
reckoning on one ball being more fortunate than another
in damaging the enemy&#39;s ship. At present, the
most powerful ironclad has four, and sometimes six or
eight, guns of large caliber, which are of from 30 to 100
tons. Every shot represents not only an enormous
sum, but also a prodigious force expended, and so
powder must not be used too lavishly, since the shot
should be in relation with the colossal power that it
represents, and the shell adopted in the navy is accompanied
with so disastrous effects that a single one, well
directed, is capable of reducing the enemy&#39;s ship to impotence.
So exercises in firing are becoming more and
more frequent, and they have a right to be multiplied,
inasmuch as the present guns are complicated affairs,
the maneuvering of which requires constant practice.</p>

<p>Our engraving represents one of these exercises performed
by the Squadron of the North, which is of recent
organization, and which consists of the three ironclads
Marengo, Suffren, and Ocean, and three coast guards
Furieux, Fulminant, and Tonnerre. Each of the ironclads
is provided with four 27 cm. guns and four
24 cm. ones, not counting the revolving guns, which
constitute the small artillery reserved for fighting torpedo
boats. The Furieux has two 34 cm. guns, and the
Tonnerre and Fulminant each two 37 cm. ones.</p>

<p>An endeavor is made, as far as possible, to practice
firing such as is done in a naval action, that is, at moving
targets. To this effect, the dispatch boat Epervier
tows a rectangular float about two meters in length,
upon which are arranged two canvas balloons kept
taut by a wooden framework. One of these balloons is
white and the other is black. Each is a meter in diameter,
and is supported by a rod which is usually a
meter in height. The vessels of the squadron successively
fire their large guns at this target, which moves
at a definite velocity. The shell, on dropping into
the water, raises an immense jet, which entirely hides
the balloons when the projectile falls in a line with and
sufficiently near the target.</p>

<p>The smoke that envelops the ships, the thunder that
echoes in the calm of the sea, and the jet that rises in
the air produce a thrilling effect and give an idea of
the power of man carried to the last expression.&mdash;<i>L&#39;Illustration</i>.</p>

MODERN CAVALRY ON THE FIELD OF BATTLE.

</a><a href="#Footnote_A_1" class="fnanchor">1</a></h2>

<p class="center">By Col. R. S. <span class="smcap">Liddell</span>.</p>

<p>I feel that some apology is due from me for coming
down to Aldershot and giving my opinions before so
many officers whose daily experience renders them
much more capable than I am of bringing this subject
forward, and it was with some hesitation that I yielded
to the flattering invitation of the Military Society of
Aldershot to read a paper here to-day on cavalry. At
the same time, if it is thought that anything I can say
can increase the success that this society has already
met with, I can only add that I render my services
most willingly. It seems to me one of the many advantages
that these meetings possess is the bringing together
of the different branches of the service, and the
mutual information they afford of each other&#39;s arm.
When we look back only a few years, we have much to
be thankful for in the disappearance of a vast amount
of prejudice that used to exist between the different
branches. Each arm thought that theirs, and theirs
only, was worth studying. Infantry officers sometimes
said, as long as their arm was sufficiently numerous
and well equipped, that, with the exception of a few
scouts and orderlies, cavalry might be dispensed with.
Artillery might think that unless guns were largely
used, no infantry could ever make an attack at all;
while cavalry officers, who were perhaps the most
conservative of all, would point to the past, and show how
every battle that had ever been fought was won by
cavalry, and ever would be.</p>

<p>Confidence in one&#39;s own arm is most desirable, and
should be fostered, if at the same time we can learn
how to work with others, remembering that while cavalry
gives the information to and hides the movements
of the army, while artillery shakes and disperses the
enemy&#39;s formation, and prepares the way for attack, it
is the infantry alone who can assault and hold the
position, and it is for their advance and to bring them
up to the point that determines the battle in the condition
most favorable to insure success that all the
efforts of the other two arms must be devoted. I have
made these preliminary remarks, as from my paper
being entirely given to the actions of cavalry, it might
appear that I am claiming more for that arm in the
battle field than is reasonable; but I wish it clearly
understood that whatever I may say is only in an auxiliary
sense to the action of infantry, and I trust that I
shall not be thought underestimating other arms,
while showing unbounded confidence in my own.</p>

<p>The necessary rest required by Europe after the exhaustion
of the wars of Napoleon resulted in the long
peace which succeeded the campaign of 1815. This,
and the improvement that took place in fire arms in
the next forty years, gave room for speculation as to
whether cavalry would play as important a part in the
future as it had done in the past, under Marlborough,
Frederick the Great, Napoleon, and Wellington. The
Crimean war helped to confirm the opinion that the
days of cavalry had gone by. No account was made of
the enormous distance by sea that the cavalry had to
be transported, the unfavorable nature of the seat of
war for that arm, the little scope given in a campaign
that resolved itself into a siege, the smallness of the
cavalry force employed, and the difficulty in keeping
up a fresh supply of horses. After this war came the
introduction and improvement in the breech loader,
and with it opinions were strengthened that cavalry
duties would be still further limited, and its traditions
for a time appear to have been lost.</p>

<p>The awakening from this transient period of theory
came from a nation not trained to arms, and it is to
the American civil war that we owe the revival that
took place in the use of the cavalry arm. The raids
made by the Confederates under Morgan, Stuart, Forrest,
and by the Federals under Sheridan, drew attention
to advanced cavalry work, such as scouting, reconnaissance,
outpost and dismounted work. As particular
examples we may select Morgan&#39;s boldest and greatest
raid in 1862, when he passed through Kentucky and
Indiana, capturing large stores from the enemy. By
his rapid and skillful marches the Federal officers were
completely bewildered. He was absent from his army
24 days, in which time he traveled 1,000 miles, capturing
17 towns and destroying all the government supplies
and arms. In a second raid he forced the Federal
army to fall back by taking possession of the railway
in its rear which brought it supplies. In October, 1862,
Stuart made his greatest raid through Pennsylvania,
around the Northern army. He set out with 1,800
cavalry and four pieces of horse artillery, and crossed
the Potomac. The telegraph wires were cut in all
directions, railways obstructed, and a large number of
horses captured, and all the public stores and buildings
were destroyed. His position at this time was very
critical, 90 miles from his own army. He considered it
less dangerous to return by the opposite way to which
he came.</p>

<p>Forrest used his cavalry in every possible manner, dismounting
in the battle field and employing it as infantry.
In October, 1864, during a raid, he impeded
the navigation of the Tennessee River, which was filled
with Federal gunboats. Choosing a strong position on
the bank, he masked his guns and awaited the approach
of the enemy&#39;s vessels. He captured a gunboat
and a transport, and manned them with his own
men; but his naval expedition did not last long. Pursued
by several gunboats, he had to run his ships on
shore, when the troopers gladly mounted their horses
again. His object was, however, gained&mdash;inspiring
alarm throughout the country and occupying a considerable
number of the enemy. Later on the Federals
copied this system, when the raids of Sheridan,
with his 10,000 horsemen, armed with the magazine
rifle and revolver, with sword attached to the saddle,
brought about the final overthrow of the Southern
army.</p>

<p>The next campaign that took place was in 1866,
known as the "Seven Weeks&#39; War," when large bodies
of cavalry were used by the Austrians and Prussians.
This campaign was of such short duration that there
was not sufficient time for the experience gained in the
use of cavalry to be utilized while the war lasted; but
when the war was over, both sides, having bought
their experience, set out to reorganize their systems,
and the course pursued by the Prussians after this campaign
in largely increasing their cavalry was fully justified
by the advantages reaped in the war in France
in 1870. At the close of the Franco-German war the
attention of the whole of Europe was called to the successful
use of German cavalry during the campaign,
more especially the advanced duties, when at times 60
miles in breadth and 50 in advance of the army was
covered by the cavalry.</p>

<p>In England, after the termination of this war, many
German military works of great value were translated
and published; the battle fields in France were visited
and described; every movement of both armies, strategical
and tactical, was studied. All this tended to
draw our attention to the extended use of the cavalry
arm in future campaigns, and the shortcomings of our
own system were carefully scrutinized. The movements
of our drill book were simplified, the careful
training of our men in shooting was more fully recognized,
and the teaching of advanced cavalry duties,
reconnaissance, outpost and dismounted work, were
gone into most thoroughly&mdash;in such a manner that I
may confidently appeal to those officers who have the
best opportunities of forming an opinion, whether our
cavalry does not bear comparison now with what is
being done in other armies, and in these matters is advancing
in a satisfactory manner. While all this good
work has been going on (and I would be the last to say
one word that might seem to depreciate its value) we
may perhaps have permitted the action of cavalry on
the field of battle to escape from sufficient notice.</p>

<p>It is for this reason I will ask your permission to
bring before you this subject, believing that the opinions
of all branches of the service being brought to
bear upon it, considerable advantage maybe obtained.
It will be my endeavor to show, not by my own arguments,
but by quotations from others, that cavalry
still has an important part to take on the battle field,
and far from its duties ending when armies come in
contact, that it is still reserved to them, as has been the
case before, to decide, perhaps by only one charge, the
issue of a whole campaign. Prince Kraft in his letters
on cavalry says: "The battle of Mars-la-Tour, won by
the bold employment of cavalry, made possible the
blockade of Metz, and afterward the surrender of the
whole of Bazaine&#39;s army. So it may be said, without
exaggeration, that the charge of Bredow&#39;s six squadrons
on that day was the turning point of the Franco-German
campaign."</p>

<p>Colonel Home, in his "Pr&eacute;cis of Modern Tactics,"
says: "The action of cavalry on the actual battle field
is by no means a thing of the past. The use of cavalry
with skill at the right moment and in the right numbers
has always been considered one of the most difficult
problems in war. Modern arms have increased
this difficulty manifold, but to say the day of cavalry
on the field of battle is past is merely another way of
saying that the knowledge of how it should be used is
wanting." Cavalry is apportioned to an army in two
capacities: (1) Divisional cavalry, that is (if possible) a
regiment, or as many squadrons as can be spared, attached
to each infantry division, acting under the
orders of the general of the division. (2) The cavalry
division, that is, a large body of cavalry composed of
several brigades, an independent body having its own
commander. On the march the divisional cavalry
covers the head and flanks of its own division: on the
field of battle it will be as near as possible to its division,
in the most sheltered spot that can be found; in
the early part of the battle it would be kept as much in
reserve as possible, &eacute;cheloned in rear of one flank of its
own infantry. It would remain there until the artillery
and musketry had effected their work, and the
enemy&#39;s flanks had become thinned and shaken. Then,
when his infantry become tired and exhausted, under
cover of the smoke, the cavalry may be further advanced.</p>

<p>Prince Kraft says: "At Sedan the divisional cavalry
were employed during the battle, charging by single
squadrons, patrolling and reconnoitering to obtain information
of the enemy and the ground. Every infantry
body is accompanied by patrols, however small."
An instance of the too early employment of cavalry in
a battle occurred at Waterloo, when Napoleon at the
commencement launched his cavalry into the fight.
The result was that although it far outnumbered the
English at first, it became so reduced, depressed, and
worn out, that it was unable afterward to offer full resistance
to the British squadrons, who were comparatively
fresh. Wellington, on the contrary, after his
first successes, kept his cavalry, as much as possible, in
reserve. The field of battle itself shows the proper
situation of cavalry, but the divisional cavalry on the
defensive side must always be at hand to fall upon the
flanks of the enemy&#39;s infantry when in extended order,
while that of the attacking side must be equally at
hand to prevent the flanks of its own infantry being
so attacked.</p>

<p>In discussing the action of divisional cavalry, the
most advantageous time for its assisting in the combat
must be considered. At what moment, if any, can infantry
be attacked by cavalry? When opposed to a
force acting on the defensive, divisional cavalry has its
operations limited, and probably in the earlier part of
an engagement, confined to watching, and, if possible,
guarding the flanks of its own attacking infantry from
surprise. It is the cavalry on the defenders&#39; side that
has the greatest opportunities. In both cases, however,
a rule must be made not to attack infantry when
it has taken up a favorable position, or before its ranks
have been shaken by artillery or musketry. Prince
Kraft, in speaking of Mars-la-Tour, says: "This same
day took place a series of cavalry charges of greater or
less importance, which all showed practically to the
cavalry the limits of their effective action against infantry.
The advancing infantry were brought to a
stand, infantry who gave way were ridden down, but
where the cavalry attacked infantry intact, the cavalry
were unable to prevail."</p>

<p>The precision of modern fire arms has necessitated
great changes in infantry tactics. To advance against
the murderous fire of the present rifle, infantry is compelled
to adopt scattered formations in small lines, and
to move forward with sudden rushes. All this lends
itself to the attacks of an active cavalry. When these
infantry attacks take place, it may be presumed that
they have already been under arms some hours, have
marched some distance, and been exposed to considerable
loss from artillery and musketry fire. Their advance
in extended formation will have commenced at
about 1,000 yards, or earlier. By this time the squadrons
opposing them will have been brought to a more
advanced position, to the nearest point to their flank
where cover is afforded, and to carry this out successfully
requires skillful handling. Files must be extended,
and short rushes made with small bodies, say
half a troop if over exposed ground, into sheltered
places. It is true that cavalry cannot hide themselves
over exposed ground as infantry can, but they have
one advantage that nothing can deprive them of&mdash;rapidity
of motion; and the distance that would take
them say 10 seconds to traverse, viz., 150 yards, would
take infantry a minute.</p>

<p>Prince Kraft writes: "No battle field is a <i>tabula
rasa</i>, for in the most exposed country there are depressions.
If strong skirmishing lines of infantry can advance
directly over a country devoid of cover, cavalry
can undoubtedly do the like, if by making use of the
lie of the ground they can gain the enemy&#39;s flank. A
skilled cavalry leader will thus undoubtedly find an
opportunity to get close to the enemy." Having arrived
at this more advanced position, say from 500 to
1,000 yards, according to the formation of the ground,
the nearer the better, the most favorable moment
to assail the flanks of the attacking infantry would
probably be immediately before the last belt of the
fighting line, and before the main body had re-enforced
them, as they are preparing for their last united rush,
and as their supports are doubling up to join them.</p>

<p>At this moment the men would be to some extent out
of breath, their attention would be fixed on the point
about to be attacked, and their flanks would be
neglected. Cavalry should then descend upon them
at the utmost speed that can be extracted from the
horses, with a good interval from knee to knee. If
there is only one squadron, one troop should take the
flank or fighting line, while the other throws itself upon
the support. As the distance to be covered in the open
will probably be not more than from 200 to 400 yards,
they will be exposed to fire, supposing none of the
ground is undulating, for fifteen to thirty seconds
when at full speed. As they close on the infantry
neither the supports nor those in rear of them or their
artillery will dare to fire, on account of their own men.
If the infantry run to get into small squares, as is most
likely, the cavalry must endeavor to catch them before
they assemble. If they get together it may be too late
for the cavalry to stop. They must then throw themselves
upon them and trust to the supporting squadron
to complete the attack.</p>

<p>Although it is rare that a battle field is on such
ground that there are no undulations to afford shelter
for cavalry in an advanced position, this may be the
case, and if so the enemy&#39;s infantry attack must be
allowed to take place, but even then, by cavalry showing
itself on the flanks for a moment, infantry would
get together and afford a better mark for fire, and the
progress of the attack would be delayed. The very
appearance of cavalry frequently frightens infantry
into masses. If the ground was too much exposed for
the charge, men might be dismounted, with their
carbines, at a safe distance to assist the infantry. If
mounted infantry were at hand, they would be utilized
in the same way, and the machine guns of the cavalry
would also pour in their volleys. If the enemy&#39;s attack
is successful, cavalry must then advance on their flanks
and take its chance, and if necessary sacrifice itself to
give its own infantry time to rally. If it is unsuccessful,
the cavalry must be ready to take every favorable
opportunity of molesting its broken ranks.</p>

<p>Speaking of Mars-la-Tour, Prince Kraft says: "During
the battle a German infantry brigade was forced to
retire with heavy loss, and ran some danger of being
annihilated by the pursuing enemy. But the First
Dragoons of the Guards threw themselves on the pursuers.
<a name="Page_10601" id="Page_10601"></a>The enemy&#39;s infantry massed round the eagles
and ceased to press on, while the thin ranks of our infantry
were able to rally, and our guns were saved and
brought into position. The losses were heavy; half a
regiment of cavalry (250 horses) were sacrificed in order
to save the brigade." At Waterloo a French division of
infantry fled before three regiments of dragoons (the
Union Brigade). The Royal Dragoons and the Inniskillings
in first line, the Scots Greys on their left rear,
the whole under Sir William Ponsonby, acting in support
of the Highland Infantry Brigade, were awaiting
the attack of the whole of the 1st French Division under
Gen. Alix. The three Scotch regiments threw into
them a concentrated fire, and as they were staggered by
the shock Ponsonby gave the order to advance. Passing
through the Highlanders, the Greys having come up
into line, the three regiments charged the leading portion
of the French column, which yielded, and those in
rear were hurled back. The dragoons having the advantage
of the descent of the hill appeared to mow
down the mass, the Greys on the left pressed on
through the supporting brigade of the French, while
the Royals drove back the right, giving no time for
fire. Many threw down their arms, while hundreds of
prisoners were hurried off to the rear of the line. At
the same time the Inniskillings forced their way
through the center, when the remainder of the French
division broke and fled.</p>

<p>It may be said that this took place before the introduction
of the rifle, and is therefore no example, but
it took place within the range of the weapon then in use,
and at that distance it was equally effective. The celebrated
charge of Bredow&#39;s brigade at Vieuville (Mars-la-Tour)
also shows what an energetic attack may do. It
had become necessary to demand a sacrifice from the
cavalry for the good of the army, to enable Prince Frederick
Charles, with only 24,000 infantry, to hold in check
Bazaine&#39;s army of 180,000 until his own main body came
up. Bredow&#39;s cavalry brigade consisted of six squadrons
of the 7th Cuirassiers and the 16th Uhlans. They
were ordered to make a breach in the front of the 16th
French Army Corps.</p>

<p>The six squadrons advanced in column, the cuirassiers
leading, when they received the word to change
direction to the right, then to form line, which was
done under heavy fire. The cuirassiers getting into line
first, charged at once, the 16th following in echelon. In
a moment the batteries, vomiting flames, were reached
with a loud hurrah, and the gunners cut down at their
guns, when the whole brigade, which had now got into
one line, charged the long lines of infantry in rear, who
received them with a heavy fire from their chassepots.
These lines, too, were broken through, and the main
object of the charge was attained, but, carried away by
the ardor of the combat, they charged and took the
mitrailleuses, when the French cuirassiers, with a
dragoon brigade in support, come down upon them,
and compelled them to fall back. This they did, having
to force their way back through the enemy&#39;s masses
of infantry with enormous loss. The object, however,
was gained, and the attack of the French corps checked
and never resumed. The cavalry division covers the
advance of the whole army, and is a day or two in front
of it. It conceals and guards the army, while finding
out the movements of the enemy. It collects information,
and is also used with horse artillery on great enterprises
on the enemy&#39;s communications. Having
finished the reconnaissance and covering the army on
the day of battle, it falls back as the two opposing sides
come in contact, and awaits further orders. On the
battle field it should be placed so as to suffer as little
loss as possible&mdash;as a rule, in rear of the flanks. How
far must depend on the formation of the ground; if
shelter is to be obtained nearer the front, the better.
If not, then some 2,000 yards in rear of one flank would
seem advisable. Its duties are to guard the exposed
flank or flanks and rear of the army, while it watches
the cavalry of the enemy. If within range of artillery,
it should be kept on the move from front to rear. Its
strength should not be wasted or frittered away on
doubtful enterprises, as it maybe required for some decisive
blow, in pursuit, or in covering the retreat.</p>

<p>Prince Kraft, speaking of the battle of St. Privat,
says: "On the 18th of August the gigantic fight of St.
Privat took place. The cavalry divisions were held
back in reserve, but the divisional cavalry took an
active part. During the battle a squadron of hussars
advanced and sent information of the enemy making a
flank movement." He also says: "At Sedan the
cavalry division was kept in reserve." The massing of
artillery at the commencement of a battle must expose
a long line with some weak spot to attack. If protected
by cavalry, then probably a cavalry combat will ensue.
Prince Kraft says: "The action of the masses of German
cavalry at Mars-la-Tour excited wonder and admiration;
they surprised the enemy&#39;s cavalry when in
bivouac, they met and surrounded the hostile infantry
in a threatening manner, and thus 8,000 cavalry occupied
65,000 infantry, until the Prussian infantry came
up. The cavalry made no charges which could not have
been successful, but carried out their task of occupying
the enemy almost without loss.</p>

<p>"In the old days these squadrons would have charged
and ridden down the infantry. The change is the result
of the improvement in fire arms." During the early
stages of a battle, advanced parties, under officers
selected for the purpose, must be kept out from the
cavalry division to watch the enemy&#39;s movements, and
the information they should be able to afford should be
invaluable to the general-in-chief. An engagement with
the enemy&#39;s cavalry should not be sought unless they
are much weaker; but should the necessity arise, the
ground should be reconnoitered, and every advantage of
position taken to insure success. The attack being determined
on, the preparations for it should be carried
out rapidly. Echelon movements have many advantages.
They favor the formation of oblique lines, they
also insure in a charge direct to the front the bringing
up of squadron after squadron in support. The attack
of Vivian&#39;s Hussar Brigade upon the French reserves at
Waterloo gives a brilliant illustration of this, and has
been termed by Siborne the "crisis of Waterloo." This
celebrated charge, intended to be in line, became virtually
a charge in echelon of squadrons in consequence of
the rapid pace of the head of the column.</p>

<p>"The movement of cavalry must be rapid and unexpected,
and bear the character of determined confidence;
an effort should be made by maneuvering to
come suddenly on the enemy&#39;s flank. A gentle declivity
for the final charge must be sought. The rapid,
vigorous, and determined charge in line on to cavalry,
riding knee to knee, is what is required." The charge
to be made effectual, the horses must be brought up in
wind, the gallop must not be begun too early; when
begun it must gradually be increased to a fast gallop,
the final charge for the last sixty yards made with every
horse extended. "Nothing, then, must be left undone to
excite the spirit of enthusiasm, even to ferocity; then,
and only then, the &#39;cheer&#39; to be raised." At Waterloo
the charge of the heavy brigade, the 1st and 2d Life
Guards and King&#39;s Dragoon Guards, with the Blues in
support, is a good example of a successful attack on
cavalry. The French line of cavalry as it advanced presented
an imposing appearance.</p>

<p>They had ascended the brow of the ridge, when a
vigorous fire from Ross&#39; Horse Artillery was opened on
to them. In the next moment their trumpets sounded
the charge and they rushed to the attack, and as cuirassiers
approached the British squares, the Heavy Brigade
dashed into them. The shock was terrific. The
right of the Life Guards being thrown forward, came
first into collision. The right of the French was suddenly
thrown out by coming unexpectedly on to a hollow
way, and as they passed it the 2d Life Guards
came full speed upon them. The French cuirassiers
were driven back and pursued until the English brigade
came under infantry fire.</p>

<p>The charge of the Heavy Cavalry Brigade at Balaklava,
under Gen. Scarlett, is another good example,
when the Russian cavalry, receiving the British charge
at a halt, were entirely overthrown. One of the greatest
difficulties after the charge is to know when and how
to stop, and it is then that the squadron and troop
leaders, well in front of their men, must use all their efforts
to carry out the ends of their commander. I think
this is the time when a strong whistle carried by the
commanding officer and the squadron leaders can be
used with good effect. Being an unusual sound, it would
attract attention. The battle being over, some of the
most serious duties of cavalry commence. If the enemy
is victorious, the pursuit has immediately to follow.
History points out the difficulty of carrying this out.
Uncertainty of the victory, or how far it can be counted
on, often delays its commencement. Battles are often
ended by nightfall, valuable time is lost, and the golden
opportunities are past. An active cavalry leader will,
however, without further orders at least, follow with
his advanced parties and not lose touch of the enemy.
He will soon learn the condition of the enemy, act accordingly,
harass his flanks and rear and play upon
him with his artillery.</p>

<p>An example of another manner in which cavalry may
be employed after a victory can be taken from the
Egyptian campaign of 1882, when, after the battle of
Tel-el-Kebir, by a rapid advance of the cavalry some
fifty miles ahead of the infantry, the capital of the
country was captured by the English cavalry division.</p>

<p>If the battle is lost, still greater are the responsibilities
of the cavalry. Detached squadrons with scouts must be
sent round the flanks to ascertain the strength of the
enemy sent in pursuit. Every available position must
be taken up by the horse artillery, and every advantage
seized for counter attack. Above all, accurate information
must be obtained for the general-in-chief of
the nature of the pursuit, in order that he may not
harass his main body by falling back further than
necessary. This subject, however, is beyond the scope
of this lecture, and is one of study of past campaigns.</p>

<p>Of the action of cavalry in savage warfare, the recent
campaigns in Africa have given some experience.
In the presence of an enemy met with in such enormous
numbers as in the desert, cut off from all help,
knowing that unless you win you die, it seems to be
decided that our infantry must adopt the square as the
most suitable formation. In the Zulu war, the cavalry
at the battle of Ulundi was placed inside the square.
The experience met with there was exceptional, and
from the swarms of savages surrounding the square in
all directions it was considered desirable to keep the
17th Lancers in the center of it, in order that they
should not interfere with the infantry fire, and that
when the enemy was repulsed, they should be launched
out upon them, and this was done with perfect success.
It is, however, contrary to the instincts and traditions
of cavalry to be shut up in a square, and, where practicable,
I should think cavalry outside a square, even
at some distance out of the way of the infantry fire,
acting with horse artillery, would very much disturb
the attacking bodies of the enemy, and perhaps attract
away a portion of them, and they could be brought up,
when called upon to do so, to carry out the pursuit.</p>

<p>In the first campaign on the east coast of the Soudan,
on the advance to El Teb and afterward to Tokar,
squadrons were sent in front and on the flanks of the
square with scouts thrown out to feel the way and obtain
information, while the main body of the cavalry
was echeloned on the rear and flank opposite an angle
of the square in the most suitable manner to avoid any
interference with its fire. During the action it remained
in this position until after the first attack on
the square, when it moved away past the square on
the outward flank and acted on the enemy&#39;s rear and
engaged their reserves until the action was over. During
the desert march in the Nile expedition, the 19th
Hussars, by its scouting, protected the square and gave
it timely notice of the approach of the enemy.</p>

<p>In a country where a great deal of bush abounds the
effective charge of cavalry on to groups of savages is
very much curtailed. The Arabs throw themselves on
to the ground behind the prickly bushes, the ranks are
opened out as the horses avoid the thorns, and the men
get no chance of using their swords; but although
much execution is not achieved under these circumstances,
the natives have great fear of cavalry, and
they are prevented from attacking elsewhere. When
their attention is thus occupied, horse artillery and
machine guns might make great havoc among them.
At the action of Tamai, where the ground, from the
rocks and ravines of the neighboring mountains, was
unsuitable for cavalry charges, when one of the infantry
squares was broken, the cavalry advanced, and
one squadron of the 10th Hussars, dismounting, helped
to create a favorable diversion by pouring fire into the
flanks of the attacking Arabs.</p>

<p>My remarks would, I think, be considered incomplete
if I did not touch on the question of cavalry
charging squares, as this point is always made very
prominent in all discussions on the action of cavalry.
I therefore must not pass it by. I will say at once that
I think it most undesirable, even under favorable circumstances,
that cavalry should charge a formed
square and men armed with the breech loader. At
best the gain can be but local and partial, while the
loss to the cavalry&mdash;an arm so difficult to keep up in
numbers&mdash;must be disastrous, and it seems to me that
if cavalry by its appearance can force infantry to form
square, it has done enough, and that the artillery, infantry,
and machine guns should do the rest. The
necessity might, however, arise, and by looking at the
past we see its possibility. At Langensalza two Prussian
squares were broken by the Hanoverian cavalry,
and the major part taken prisoners.</p>

<p>We have only to turn to the recent campaigns in
Egypt to see the effect of determined rushes of men,
intending to succeed, charging on to squares carefully
formed on ground affording shelter, with an enormous
amount of fire being poured upon them. It will be
said that these men were fanatics, but our cavalry, too,
have been, and will be, fanatics in a charge; and
I still think, if the necessity recurs, that an attack,
properly conducted on favorable ground, one troop
charging on the corner of a square, followed by another
at double distance, others in echelon on both
flanks immediately following, the whole charging with
the greatest impetuosity, intended to win, will break
down any square that Englishmen are likely to meet
with. If we look back again on the past, we will find
many instances of British cavalry not being called
upon in vain to make a sacrifice. At Talavera, the
23d Light Dragoons, supported by the 1st Hussars of
the German Legion, advanced against the French
squares. In their impetuous rush they came upon a
hollow cleft covered with long grass, eight feet deep,
and eighteen feet broad. Too late to pull up, the foremost
rode headlong into it, some tumbled in, others
over it, some rode boldly at it and gained the other
side. Still they went on, swept past the infantry columns,
and fell upon a brigade of French chasseurs.</p>

<p>At Balaklava 670 British horsemen were launched
against an entire wing of the Russian army. The brigade,
at first in two lines, the 11th Hussars, 17th Lancers,
and 13th Light Dragoons, followed by the 4th
Light Dragoons and 8th Hussars, advanced down a
gradual descent of three-quarters of a mile; the Russian
guns vomiting shell and shot upon them, one battery
bearing on their right, another on their left, and
all the intermediate ground covered with riflemen.
The guns were charged and forced through, the forces
drawn up in rear were overpowered. They then had
to turn, and, retiring up hill, ran through the same
gauntlet. In the Sikh war, at the battle of Ferozeshah,
the 3d Light Dragoons charged the enemy&#39;s entrenchments
at a point defended by some of their
heaviest batteries. When within 250 yards the regiment
moved at speed under a destructive fire of grape
and musketry, and pressing forward at the charge entered
the enemy&#39;s camp and captured the whole of the
batteries.</p>

<p>Cavalry attacks have been made with success after
dark, and the advantage, of course, is gained of obviating
opposing fire. Prince Kraft mentions that after
the battle of Mars-la-Tour, the cavalry division, re-enforced
by the divisional cavalry, rode forward to complete
the advantages gained. It was almost night, and
fault has been found with making the attack in the
dark. If the ground is well known a night attack may
be advisable. While criticising it, we have to think
of the feelings of a half-defeated army about to bivouac
being attacked by unknown forces in the dark. In
this case, at Vionville, the enemy did not wait for a
second, but withdrew, and abandoned the whole field
of battle. Prince Kraft quotes the attack of Bl&uuml;cher
at Gross-Gorchen and a cavalry attack at Loon. During
the first Egyptian campaign the Life Guards made
an attack by moonlight at Kassassin.</p>

<p>I have now, I think, touched lightly on some important
cavalry duties on a campaign. In some points
perhaps these remarks may appear contradictory.
How to combine keeping cavalry in reserve for any
great action it may be called upon to perform, while
using it unsparingly to assist on the battle field, if the
necessity arises. It may, however, be noticed that,
much as they may be criticised, few cavalry commanders
have been severely blamed when they have thought
it best to take the bolder course. To insure to cavalry
the power of carrying out its duties successfully in war,
organization and practice in peace is most essential.
Infantry may suddenly be increased without much deranging
its action in the field, but cavalry cannot be
hurried into an increased augmentation. In tactics
simplicity in every evolution and rapidity in execution
are the most important principles. This simplicity of
drill, I think, might be assisted if our squadrons were
divided into four divisions, zuges, or pelotons. When
squadrons have 48 files in the front rank there might
be four of these, while weak regiments with 36 files
could drill equally as well with three divisions. This
system, introduced by the late Gen. Valentine Baker
into the English service for a time, and now used by all
European countries, was found to work well.</p>

<p>I think the whistle could be carried with advantage
by all cavalry officers. For advanced work attention can
be drawn by it without being heard at a distance like a
bugle. In movements the commanding officers would
find it useful to call the attention of leaders to himself,
especially in extended or &eacute;chelon formation. I have
omitted to make much mention of the action of horse
artillery combined with cavalry, as it seems beyond
the limits of this paper; but it is one to which the
cavalry officer&#39;s attention requires to be brought most
strongly to bear. I would also have wished to have
made some remarks on the many advantages to be obtained
by having mounted infantry attached to cavalry.
I understand that this force would be under the orders
of the cavalry general, and if so, I think a cavalry division
well found in horse artillery, with mounted infantry,
whether conveyed on horses, or, where the
cavalry admitted of it, on cars, and accompanied by
machine guns on wheels, could act in such an independent
manner as to enable it to penetrate far ahead into
an enemy&#39;s country, or threaten his communications,
and be absent from its main body for many days or
weeks.</p>

<p>As regards the English cavalry, I think it may be
said, without boasting, that the material is excellent.
The men are of the best physique, recruited from a
good class, and plenty of them to be had. The non-commissioned
officers are intelligent and always ready
for instruction; the riding compares favorably with
cavalry of other nations, certainly far better than any
<a name="Page_10602" id="Page_10602"></a>I have ever seen abroad, either German, Russian, or
French, and among all foreign countries we have the
reputation of being the best horsemen in the world,
which at all events has a good moral effect. Our horses
are undoubtedly first-rate, having more quality and
greater speed than foreigners. We have in our officers
the exact stuff we want. Their very sports and amusements
start them with all the makings of cavalry soldiers.
But the quickness of eye, the self-confidence
and readiness that these sports and games may give,
require nowadays more than ever something beyond
this to produce the trained cavalry leader. Cavalry is
an arm of opportunity, and above all others depends
greatly on its leaders, but with the chances now available
of reading, in every detail, the campaigns of the
past, if taken advantage of, as is now daily becoming
more common, we should produce in the future the
best and most accomplished cavalry officers that this
country or any other has ever seen.</p>

IRON SAILING SHIPS.</h2>

<p>Messrs. Russell &amp; Co., Greenock and Port Glasgow,
show at the Glasgow exhibition a very numerous and
varied show of sailing models. First, we find the noble
four-masted ships of from 1,800 tons to 2,200 tons, which
sail and carry well on their tonnage, and which are
worked by fewer hands than are required for a ship of
the same burden with three masts but squarer yards.
Some owners prefer the latter, and so Messrs. Russell
show not only such handsome specimens as the four-masted
Falls of Earn, but also the three-masted Ardencraig
and Soudan. One of the favorite models of this
firm is that of their 1,500 ton ship with three masts, represented
by the Cromartyshire, of which type they
have built a large number of vessels noted alike for
their carrying capacity and their excellent sailing
qualities. The Main, built for Mr. James Nourse, of
London, is a good specimen of their 1,700 ton ship, as
designed for the special trade of the owner, between
Calcutta, Demerara, and London. Their 1,300 ton
bark is represented by the model of the Aboukir Bay
and her sisters of the Bay Line, owned by Messrs. Hatfield,
Cameron &amp; Co., of Glasgow; while their 1,000
ton barks are shown in the model of the Banca, belonging
to Messrs. P. Denniston &amp; Co., of the same
city. These are about the smallest class of sailing ships
built during recent years, the demands of the shipping
trade being such as to make it unprofitable to sail anything
smaller than about 1,500 tons; while the tendency
is to exceed 2,000 tons in burden, and to reach
even as high as 3,000 tons.&mdash;<i>The Engineer</i>.</p>

WATER BLAST PUMP.</h2>

<p>It is well known that the principle which is applied
to the construction of vacuum or filter pumps, and
which aims at the production of rarefied air in a certain
inclosed space, may also be applied to the production
of air <i>pressure</i>.</p>

<p>A simple apparatus by which this may be accomplished
has recently been constructed by A. Beutell.</p>

<p>A tall cylindrical flask, K (see cut), is provided with
an outlet tube near the bottom, and its stopper carries
two tubes, one (M) for the entrance of a jet of water,
and the other (L) for the exit of the compressed air,
which may be conducted to a blast lamp or wherever
air under pressure may be needed. The column of
water entering through M causes air to be sucked in
through the little hole at c, and this air, after arriving
in the flask, is gradually compressed by the continuously
entering water.</p>

<p>In order that the apparatus may work properly, it is
necessary to construct the tube, M, in a particular manner,
and of certain definite proportions. Fig. 3 exhibits
its bore and shape in an enlarged view. A short distance
below the orifice of the tube it is slightly expanded, and
then gradually contracts to the place, <i>b</i>. It then again
expands to an oblong cavity, and contracts again to a
neck, <i>e</i>, which is a trifle wider than that at <i>b</i>, and which
must be so situated that the column of water passing
through <i>b</i> is exactly perpendicular to the center of the
aperture at <i>e</i>.  The tube then expands again to its
original diameter, and is slightly curved, which is done
to prevent any of the compressed air in the cylinder, K,
from regurgitating upward.</p>

<p>The outlet tube at A is preferably constructed as
shown in Fig. 2. Instead of being made of one piece,
it is there represented as consisting of two pieces joined
together by rubber tubing, a sort of check valve, G,
being introduced into the rubber joint. By regulating
the check valve, that is by approaching it more or less
to the exit of the tube, A, the outflow of water may be
regulated. It is important to adjust this so that the
cylindrical flask will always be at least half full, and
never over three-fourths filled. While the column of
water falls through the aperture at <i>b</i>, into the expanded
portion of M, it aspirates air through the little orifice,
<i>c</i>, communicating with the outer air, and this air is
carried along with it into the flask, where it accumulates
until it is under a pressure equal to that of the
column of water entering the apparatus, when the
latter will cease to flow. By allowing the air to escape
through L, more will be successively compressed, so
that a steady blast may be obtained.</p>

<span class="caption">BEUTELL&#39;S WATER BLAST PUMP.</span>
</div>

<p>The proportions between the diameters of the expanded
and contracted portions of the glass tube, M,
are important. If the bore at <i>b</i> amounts to 2.5 millimeters,
that at e should be 3 millimeters. Under these
circumstances, and with a pressure of water equal to a
column of 61.7 cubic centimeters, the apparatus will
furnish 890 liters of air for every 1,000 liters of water
consumed. If the two diameters were: <i>b</i>, 1 millimeter,
and <i>e</i>, 2.4 mm., one liter of water aspirates 2.35 liters of
air. These proportions are, no doubt, capable of improvement.&mdash;<i>Chem.

TRANSMISSION OF POWER BETWEEN BODIES
MOVING AT DIFFERENT VELOCITIES.</h2>

<p>A few months ago there was exhibited, in the society&#39;s
reading room, a working model of an application
to railway working of what the inventor calls "division
of the mass." In causing a body, moving at a
high velocity, to communicate motion to another at
rest, or moving at a lower velocity, he splits one of
them up into parts all the more numerous, and therefore
tenuous, as the difference in velocity is greater;
and this is accomplished by causing one of the parts to
take the form of a brush composed of metal fibers.</p>

<p>In applying this principle to the transmission of
motion for driving machinery, a disk, fitted with segmental
brushes, is slid laterally along the shaft, so
that the fibers come into contact with radial projections
on a second disk; and, although the contact is
made instantaneously, the action is exerted gradually,
owing to the flexibility of the fibers. That is to say,
the full power is communicated without any shock.</p>

<p>A similar arrangement, but with one of the disks
fixed, serves as a brake for arresting motion, and this
again without shock, but with gradually increasing
action. Where space is very much circumscribed, the
clutch and the brake may be combined, by fitting a
disk with brushes on one side, and projections on the
other, so that it may be brought by a lever against a
second disk, for transmitting motion, and against a
third, fixed, for stopping it.</p>

<p>Safety appliances for arresting the descent of mine
cages, in the event of the rope breaking, have hitherto
depended upon the entrance of claws into the guides,
or the clipping of the latter, or the wedging of the
cage between the guides.</p>

<p>In this application of the system, the guides of the
shaft are fitted with corrugated iron plates, and the
sides of the cage with steel brushes. In the normal
state of working, the brushes are kept clear of the
guides, but, should the rope break, a small brush, fitted
on a sector, constantly rubbing against the corrugations
of the guides, aided by a spring or counterweight,
brings the main brushes into contact with the
guides by a link arrangement, like that of the parallel
ruler, thus arresting the cage, and holding it suspended
until the brushes are gradually relaxed, for "braking"
the cage slowly down to the next landing.</p>

<p>Many attempts have been made to cause a locomotive,
running at full speed, to exert such a mechanical
action as would set a signal to danger, so as to protect
the train from another following in the rear. By fitting
the engine with a steel brush, attached to the
axle boxes, so as to preserve a uniform height with
respect to the rails, a stationary lever may be gradually
moved, so that the signal is set at "danger" without
shock. Moreover, by means of another brush, in
the event of the engine being turned upon the wrong
line, a lever may be made to shut off the steam, apply
the brakes, blow the whistle, or move an index on a
dial, recording a neglect of duty, or may exert these
four actions simultaneously.</p>

<p>All the above applications of this principle&mdash;"the
division of the mass"&mdash;have been tested experimentally,
the last named by the model above referred to.
The clutch arrangement has transmitted six horse
power from a petroleum motor, making 200 revolutions
a minute, to a dynamo making 2,000 revolutions, while
applications to industrial purposes are now being
made, both in this country and in Belgium. The inventor
of the system is M. Raymond Snyers, Ing&eacute;nieur

STEAM GENERATOR OF SERPOLLET BROTHERS,
PRODUCING STEAM INSTANTANEOUSLY.</h2>

<p>The explosibility of a steam generator may be measured
by the relation of its total capacity to its vaporizing
power. The old fashioned generators and some of
the modern ones are so constructed as to contain from
fifteen to twenty times more water than they are able
to vaporize within one hour. Thus a great quantity of
heat is obtained and a uniform pressure assured, but the
steam-generating apparatus is costly, heavy, and cumbersome;
it requires a long time before the necessary
pressure is obtained, and the generator is only suitable
for a stationary installation and where it can uninterruptedly
work for a long period of time. Besides, the
enormous quantity of hot water under pressure constitutes
a constant danger, and the explosion of a steam
generator with boiler tubes becomes a real disaster.</p>

<p>In order to satisfy the requirements which have
newly arisen in connection with navigation, locomotion,
small motors and apparatus which need for their working
an intermittent supply of steam, it became necessary
to modify the construction of steam boilers, to augment
their heating surface, to diminish their residue of
water, and to gradually construct so-called <i>inexplosible</i>
apparatus, of which the Belleville boiler forms one
of the most characteristic prototypes.</p>

<p>In trying to reduce the inexplosibility to the utmost,
Messrs. Serpollet Brothers have succeeded in constructing
a type of boilers which may be called <i>absolutely inexplosible</i>,
and this result has been obtained by reducing
the capacity of the boiler to practically <i>nil</i>, thus
rendering the explosibility also <i>nil</i>, for under the circumstances
<a name="Page_10603" id="Page_10603"></a>the relation between capacity and vaporizing
power becomes itself <i>nil</i>.</p>

2. Cross section of boiler (natural size). The line
A B indicates, at somewhat exaggerated scale, the
cross section of the interior empty space of the
boiler.
</p></div>

<p>The method employed for this purpose by Messrs.
Serpollet is an extremely simple one. A cylindrical
steel tube of convenient diameter and sufficient thickness
is rolled flat at a temperature below the white heat
of the metal, and the last touch of the rollers is given to
it when already cold. By this means a flat tube is obtained,
the empty interior space of which looks in a cross
section (Fig. 1, No. 2) like a black line not thicker than
a hair, and measures from 0.1 to 0.3 millimeter. This
tube is finally rolled up in the form of a spiral, or left
straight, according to the use to be made of it, and put
into an appropriate furnace (Fig. 1, No. 1). To either
end of the tube a joint is attached, the one for the purpose
of admitting the water, the other for admitting
the steam.</p>

<p>When under these circumstances the tube has been
heated to a high temperature in a convenient fire box,
the water which has been pumped into it, by a feed
pump fastened to one of its extremities, is instantly
changed into steam and escapes at the other end at a
pressure and in a state of dryness depending on the
working conditions of the apparatus. The ingenious
and really original and novel idea in this invention is
this flattened tube, which constitutes an actual capillary
boiler inside of which the water squeezed in between
its walls cannot assume its spheroidal state, and
the formation of drops becomes absolutely impossible.
There exists no longer a residue of hot water, nor are
water gauges, safety valves, or any other of those numerous
accessories required which make all steam boilers
so complicated and which augment considerably
their cost.</p>

<p>It also becomes unnecessary to connect the joint from
which the steam escapes by means of a valve with the
motor for which the steam is to be used. If the supply
of steam is to be stopped, this can be done by simply
suppressing the supply of water, <i>i.e.</i>, by <i>emptying the
boiler</i>.</p>

<p>The regular working is assured by the quantity of
heat contained in the heated iron tube, to which, for
this purpose, an intentionally great thickness has been
given, and it is this heat of the iron which replaces the
heat furnished by the hot water in the steam generators
with boiler tubes. From the above it will be easy to
understand the general arrangement of the new steam
generator, when connected with its motor. This motor
works a small intermitting pump, which supplies the
capillary boiler with water, according to the quantity
consumed. The machine is started by means of a small
special pump worked by hand.</p>

<p>Whenever the velocity of the motor tends to increase,
a centrifugal regulator placed upon the motor reduces
the action of the pump and, consequently, the supply
of water to the tube, thus checking the velocity of
the machine. If the velocity tends to slacken, the inverse
process is employed. In order to stop the machine,
it suffices to turn off the water furnished by the
pump by means of a three-way cock, and to send the
water back to the reservoir of supply. The boiler can
be emptied in less than a second, and the motor stops in
consequence of being deprived of motive power.</p>

<p>The whole is marvelously simple, and creates astonishment
and admiration in the mind of even the most
skeptical persons who see the apparatus.</p>

<p>The boiler of the one horse power type weighs 33
kilogrammes. It consists of an iron tube having a
length of 2 meters and a height of 10.5 centimeters
after it has been flattened; the total heating surface
thus obtained being 48 square centimeters. The power
of vaporization amounts to 20 kilogrammes of water
per hour, while the quantity of coal consumed during
the same period amounts to only 4 kilogrammes, which
is comparatively little for a boiler of so small a power.</p>

<span class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 2.&mdash;TRICYCLE PROPELLED BY A SERPOLLET
BOILER</span>
</div>

<p>Fig. 2 shows the first model of a tricycle constructed
by Messrs. Serpollet as an application of their boiler
for locomotion. The writer has seen the working of
this apparatus, and consequently is able to give some
data. The total weight of the machine is 185 kilogrammes,
or about 250 kilogrammes when mounted by
a person. The boiler is placed behind the tricycle, the
motor is under the seat, inside of which is the water
reservoir and the supply of coal. In the motor employed
in the present case the feed pump is a constant
supply pump, but by means of a directing lever turning
around its own axis and acting upon a three-way
cock, the water can be divided into two streams, the
one emptying into the feeding reservoir, the other into
the boiler. By varying the position of the cock, the
power of the machine can be modified and its velocity
regulated. The machine can be brought to a stop within
less than two meters by means of the combined action
of a brake and the complete suppression of water in
the boiler. In order to start the machine, the water is
sent into the tube by a little extra pump worked for a
moment by the left hand of the cyclist when starting.</p>

<p>On July 25 some experiments were made before the
Society of Civil Engineers with the tricycle above
described, and on that occasion it traversed the Rue
Girardon and the Rue de Norvino to Montmartre
(streets in which the gradient rises to 15 centimeters
per meter) with a velocity of three meters per second.</p>

<p>Fig. 3 represents the arrangement of the first stationary
boiler of the new kind. The letters of reference will
suffice to indicate the position of the principal parts of
it, the forms of which may be varied according to the
object for which the boiler is to be used.</p>

<p>Messrs. Serpollet are occupied at present with studying
the special arrangements which will be needed for
connecting their boiler with a quadricycle, a torpedo
boat, a stove, a locomotive, or a stationary machine of
10 horse power, and with rectangular parts.</p>

<p>The inexplosibility of their boiler has been tested
during an experiment made before the engineers of
mines, on which occasion a manometer (steam gauge)
graduated for a pressure of upward 200 kilogrammes
per square centimeter was used, and the pressure raised
far beyond the limits indicated. The result was that
the hand of the manometer, being pressed against the
walls of the box, became bent, and though the boiler
was submitted to a pressure the degree of which it
was impossible to measure, it was not changed in the
slightest.</p>

<p>Incrustation of the boiler is not to be feared, for, in
consequence of the great velocity with which the
steam circulates through the tube, the solid matter dissolved
in the water becomes pulverized and is forced
out, mechanically assisting to lubricate and polish the
parts of the motor.</p>

<p>The invention of Messrs. Serpollet is still too new to
foretell all its possible applications, but their apparatus,
in its present form, is exactly the steam generator
which will be useful for producing a small motive force;
while it will be necessary to wait until it has been ascertained,
by further study, how the system can economically
be used for high motive power.</p>

<p>The most natural and immediate application of the
invention seems to be its use for the electric lighting of
restaurants, in which case one of the instantaneous
vaporization tubes might be connected with stoves
which remain lighted all day, and which might thus
besides supply the necessary motive force to work a
small dynamo charging some accumulators.&mdash;<i>E. Hospitalier,

GAS LIGHTING BY HIGH-POWER BURNERS.</h2>

<p>In the course of a communication presented to the
Societe Industrielle du Nord de la France by the manager
of the Wazemmes Gas Company, he made the
following remarks on gas lighting with high-power
burners:</p>

<p>For gas of a standard illuminating value, the lighting
power increases with the temperature of the flame.
It also increases, under favorable conditions, if the
quantity of gas consumed by the burner in a certain
period is augmented. Thus, two burners consuming
60 liters (rather more than 2 cubic feet) of gas, placed
in juxtaposition, produce less light than one burner
consuming 120 liters. As it is impossible to indefinitely
increase the supply to ordinary burners, multiple-flame
burners have been invented, in which two or
more ordinary flames are united so that they may impinge
upon each other. By an ingenious arrangement
for bringing the air into contact with the multiple
flames, two excellent types of lamps are obtained, consuming
respectively 700 and 1,400 liters per hour, which
meet with a rapid demand in Paris, and in many other
towns, for lighting wide public thoroughfares, squares,
and large open spaces. If, however, it is desired to obtain
a flame with a much higher temperature, it is
necessary to resort to a special arrangement for heating
the air intended for combustion with the gas. The
principle of heating the air by means of waste heat
escaping with the products of the waste gas&mdash;the regenerative
principle&mdash;was adopted by Mr. F. Siemens,
and applied not only to gas burners, but to high temperature
stoves. With the Siemens burner on the regenerative
principle the following results are obtained:
With a consumption of 150 liters per hour, the light
of from 1 to 3 carcels; 250 to 300 liters, 6 to 7 carcels;
600 liters, 15 carcels; 800 liters, 20 to 22 carcels; 1,600
liters, 46 to 48 carcels; 2,200 liters, 72 carcels. Unfortunately,
the construction of the Siemens Argand
lamps is very delicate, and, moreover, they have the
disadvantage of being heavy and rather unsightly. In
Germany they have been widely adopted; but in
France they have met with but little success. The
Schulke lamp is made on the same principle; and this
appears to be too delicate to come into general use.
One of the latest burners of the regenerative class is the
Wenham, which has been before the public for some
time in England and is now being adopted in France.
In point of fact it is merely a very effective improvement
on Breittmayer&#39;s burner, from which it differs
only in its construction; being produced in some elegant
styles, which lend themselves perfectly to the
decorations of private houses. The No. 2 lamp of this
type, with a consumption of 283 liters (10 cubic feet)
per hour, has given 126 candles, in a vertical direction
without reflectors: horizontally, 50 candles. But the
gas employed in the tests had an illuminating power
about 20 per cent. higher than that usual in Paris.
When experimenting in Paris with a No. 3 lamp in a
vertical direction, it showed a consumption of 34.6
liters (1.2 cubic feet) per carcel obtained. The Wenham
lamp is constructed to give light in a vertical
direction; and by adopting a large reflector, the illuminating
power is increased 18 per cent. in a vertical
line and 55 per cent. at 80&deg;, which is a highly satisfactory
result. There are at present five sizes of these
lamps. There is also the Delmas hot air burner, in
which the batswing flame is completely inclosed in a
glass, mounted with a sheet-iron casing, heated by the
products of combustion, through which the air passes
on its passage downward to feed the flame; and it
thus increases the temperature, improves the illuminating
power, and produces a beautiful steady light.
Mention also may be made of the Siemens radiated
heat burner, by means of which the heating of the air
is effected simply by the radiation of the metallic parts
of the appliance which are in contact with the flame.
These burners produce the light of 1 carcel (9.5 candles)
with a gas consumption of 70 liters (about 2&frac12; cubic
feet), and are therefore, from an economical point of
view, intermediary between the high power and regenerative
burners. This degree of economy can be
ascertained by an ingenious arrangement of the air
supply in a burner with holes, which has been made in
in the laboratory of the Wazemmes Gas Company by
M. Verl&eacute;, the engineer, who has invented a very simple
burner called the "Lillois," with which the light of 1
carcel is obtained with a consumption of 70 liters.
<a name="Page_10604" id="Page_10604"></a>This produces a tulip-shaped flame, and it has a
specially constructed glass arrangement on the outside
for regulating the combustion. Comparing the above-mentioned
burners with each other, we arrive at the
following results: The "Lillois" burner consumes 70
liters of gas per carcel; the Siemens ordinary, 70
liters; the Siemens-Breittmayer, 35 to 39 liters; the
Wenham, about 35 liters. Taking this into account,
and considering that a carcel corresponds with 105 liters
of gas consumed in the Bengal form of burner, we see
that the economy in gas might, by employing these
burners, reach from 33 to 71 per cent. If this is compared
with the batswing burner, which produces the
light of 1 carcel with a consumption of 120 liters of gas,
the economy is greater&mdash;varying, according to the type
of lamp, from 41 to 85 per cent.</p>

SYNCHRONIZING CLOCKS.</h2>


<p>At the recent meeting of the Institution of Mechanical
Engineers, Dublin, Mr. Davey, of Leeds, spoke of
synchronizing mechanisms. He had occupied some of
his spare time in attempting to synchronize clocks
from a standard clock. The problem is similar to the
present one, except that it is rough-and-ready, compared
to the present one. He had a novel electrical
pendulum, to drive a seconds pendulum by electricity.
Electrical clocks are notoriously bad timekeepers; on
account of variation in the strength of the electrical
current, the battery falls off. He had constructed an
electric clock having a seconds pendulum, and recording
an impulse once a minute. On the pendulum he
had a little ratchet wheel, R, having thirty teeth. The
pawl was connected with a lever, M, fixed at the top.
On the face of the wheel a little pin rotates with the
wheel. On the side of the clock case was a contact
maker, which closed the circuit by the pin on the
ratchet wheel, R, once every minute. The weight was
lifted by the electric current, and by its fall gave an
impulse to the pendulum. The pendulum was a free
swinging pendulum for 59 sec., and the increase of the
arc could scarcely be detected.</p>

COAL TAR AS FUEL FOR STEAM BOILERS.</h2>

<p class="center">By <span class="smcap">John <ins class="tnote" title="Original text M'Crae">McCrae</ins></span>, of Dundee.</p>

<p>About three years ago, when the sudden and serious
fall took place in the value of the secondary products
produced in gas works, many gas managers&mdash;ever desirous
of doing their very best for their employers&mdash;were
forced to look around for some better market in
which to dispose of the products which had so seriously
fallen in value. This was no easy task; and even now
it forms very uphill work indeed. A comparatively
new market has been created for the disposal of boiled
tar at several of the German ports. But the expense
and difficulty of loading ships with tar in casks take
very much from the saving derived from the new manner
of disposal. It occurred to me, therefore, that we
must look nearer home for a remedy.</p>

<p>In all gas works of any magnitude, a considerable
quantity of fuel must be employed for the purpose of
supplying the works with steam for the exhauster engines,
chemical apparatus, thawing purposes, etc.
Whether this fuel consists of coke or of coal, will not in
the least affect or alter my figures. I have no doubt if
any manager discovers that he is working more economically
by selling the coke and using a cheap small or
other coal, he will adopt the cheapest process. In
Dundee, where we get a good price for coke, I found,
for the purpose of steam fuel, it would be far cheaper
to buy small coal costing from 5s. to 5s. 6d. per ton delivered
in the works, and dispose of the coke. The
question of fuel then lay between coal and tar; and I
have experimented somewhat extensively to ascertain
the true relative values of the two classes of fuel. For
the purpose of this paper, and within the last few days,
I made a further examination into the question; and
the results arrived at will be those here quoted. The
coal we employed was what is known as Stravenhouse
small coal, which costs 5s. per ton delivered. The experiment
in each case lasted 48 hours. The tar employed
was what is known as boiled tar; the naphtha
having been previously removed, but the pitch oil left
in the tar. The value of this tar in Dundee is about
4s. per ton. The following are the figures:</p>


<div class='center'>
<table border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" summary="">
<tr>
<td align="left">Coal, 10 tons 16 cwt., at 5s.</td>
<td>&pound;</td><td align="right">2</td><td align="right">14</td><td align="right">0</td>

<tr>
<td align="left">Saving per day by using tar.</td>
<td>&pound;</td><td align="right">0</td><td align="right">17</td><td align="right">5</td>
</tr>
</table></div>


<p>And this at the longest day, when we are using a mere
fraction of steam, as compared with our winter requirements,
and consequently the profit is proportionally
less than it will be when we are in full work.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 374px;">
<img src="./images/image8.png" width="374" height="500" alt="coal tar burner" title="" />
</div>

<p>And now allow me to direct your attention for a
short time to the appliance made use of in accomplishing
this tar burning. On the wall is shown a diagram
giving in detail the injector known as C. &amp; W. Walker&#39;s
patent tar sprayer burner; and it is supplied only
by that firm. The tar, which has been brought forward
to the boilers in a thoroughly liquid state, is discharged
from the center of the injector into the furnace
of the boiler. Surrounding the center nozzle of
the injector is an annular space through which high
pressure steam passes, also into the furnace. The
meaning of this steam moving along with the tar is to
force a draught, as well as to raise the temperature of
the tar, and so partially convert the tar into vapor;
thereby making the combustion more complete. The
flow of the tar is regulated by the very delicate sluices
attached to the injectors. These valves consist of elongated
cones and plugs, and are constructed not only for
the purpose of regulating the flow of tar, but also for
removing any obstruction or incrustation which may
accumulate in the nozzle. In order to keep the tar in
a liquid state (which in the winter time is not an easy
matter), a small steam pipe is passed through the center
of the tar pipe; but, of course, no steam is discharged
among the tar, as the presence of water in the injector
prevents its correct working. The steam pipe is simply
passed through the tar pipe, and a steam trap attached
to its end. In changing from the coal or coke fuel to
the tar, little or no difficulty is experienced, and very
rarely is a shovelful of any kind of solid material required.
The furnace bars have only to be kept covered
to prevent the waste of tar and the too rapid ingress of
air; and when the furnaces are in full work, and being
well and carefully attended to, the tar will be found to
have been nearly all consumed before reaching the
solid material covering the bars. The action is very
much the same as in the paraffin oil lamp. The wick
is the medium by which the oil is brought to the point
of combustion, where it is developed into light; but
the wick remains little injured, although in close proximity
to such intense heat. The oil burns, not the
wick. In the tar furnace, the tar itself burns, and the
tar only.</p>

<p>It will be easily understood that a little experience is
necessary to enable the attendant to fully understand
the quantity of tar by which complete combustion is
to be obtained, and which in no case must be exceeded.
The moment one atom of tar is sent into the furnace
beyond that which can be thoroughly consumed, you
have then the most hideous discharge of black smoke
(carbon) which it is difficult to describe, but which can
be easily understood, and, I believe, can be seen within
a few miles of where we now sit. I should mention
that the injectors are fitted on the furnace doors; but
the connections are of such a nature that the doors can
be opened without disturbing any of the permanent
fittings.</p>

<p>And now I have told you that the results detailed in
this short paper were those obtained in the Dundee
gas works. This is so; but were I to leave the matter
here, it might be inferred that I considered similar results
might be obtained in any and every gas works.
I would not mislead you; and therefore must detain
you for a few moments longer in order to show you how
my town is different from many others. Dundee is
very peculiarly situated in this respect. It is a long
distance from any tar distiller&#39;s works capable of dealing
with the large quantity of tar we have for sale
during the winter. A large portion of the value of our
tar must, therefore, go to the railway company, to
cover the cost of transit between the two points, and
so the tar distiller can allow us but a small figure for
it at the starting point. Then again, Dundee being
far distant from the coal fields, the coal is exceptionally
high in price. I quite believe that in many of the
west country towns the coal for which we are paying
5s. per ton could be had for 3s.; and the tar for which
we are receiving 4s. per ton, they would get not much
under the double of this. Therefore, you see, in a
place so circumstanced, the figures I have given would
be most misleading. Still, I doubt not there are places
as badly situated as Dundee; and it is to such places
that my remarks are directed. I believe also that, in
many towns distant from collieries, the tar might be
sold to manufacturers for use in their steam boilers;
and such an arrangement would, I think, prove advantageous
both to the seller and the user of this liquid
fuel.</p>

<p>I think that as much has been said in regard to my
subject as is necessary; but permit me to add that I
believe there is a future for liquid fuels. I do not say
tar, but more concentrated fuels, such as crude naphthas,
paraffins, and pitch oil. When you see one of
our large steamers taking coal into her bunker, it must
have appeared to you that there was great waste of
power here. Every ton of coal laid in must require a
certain amount of power to carry it; and every ton of
coal so laid in reduces the cargo-carrying power to this
extent. A few gallons of oil will give you the steam-producing
power of a ton of coal; and this is a fact
which the owners of non-paying steamships should
note. Take our locomotives also. Everything I have
said in regard to steamships applies to them; and the
comfort to the stokers and the general reduction in
labor would be very marked indeed. Of course, it may
be argued that if there were such a large demand
created for oils for furnaces, the old fashioned law of
supply and demand might come into play, and so force
up the price of the article for which the increased demand
had taken place. But I think this state of matters
is rather remote, when we bear in mind the great
oil wells only now becoming developed, and the oils
from which can be run in bulk direct from the wells
into ships, and brought to this country at very low
rates.&mdash;<i>Journal of Gas Lighting.</i></p>

WATCH CLEANING AND REPAIRING.</h2>

<p class="center">By <span class="smcap">"Old Fogy."</span></p>

<p>Before proceeding with what I consider the best
methods in this department of the watch and jewelry
business, I will say that I do not, by any means, consider
that my way is the best, for although I have
been in the business quite a while, yet I find that I
learn something new almost every day that I live, and
expect to do so, so long as I continue in the business.
Be very particular in selecting your tools; about three
widths of screwdrivers, and keep them in the best of
order, square across the point of blade, and never use
a screwdriver too narrow nor too wide for the screw,
and in using be careful not to let it slip, and thus mar
the plates or bridges of a watch. I also recommend
that the handles of these screwdrivers be of different
shapes or styles, so as to save time in picking up the
one you want (and just here I will say that every device
or method that saves time will be of great value to
the operator); then have about the same number of
tweezers (3), one of good, solid, heavy points, say 1/16
inch wide at the points, for taking down a watch, and
handling the heavier parts, and then one a little finer,
and one very fine to work in about the train, hairspring,
etc., and always keep these tweezers in perfect
order at the points, so that whatever you handle, you
will not mar or drop the things you are handling.
Right in this connection I will say that I cannot find
tweezers that suit me. So I make my own, and you can
do the same if you will by selecting some nice steel. Then
a good assortment of pliers, cutting, flat, and round.
In selecting brushes, you will have to be very particular
and secure the open and straight bristle brushes,
which are also hard to find these latter years. Take
all the coarser brushes and hold them on a coarse grindstone,
running them whole length, both ways; this
takes off the new rough end of the bristles before using
first time. Then there are punches, broaches, drills,
calipers, countersinks, files, etc., etc. Besides this, I
have adopted the plan of making any tool I happen to
need for any special purpose, so that by making these
at the time I happen to want a tool that I cannot purchase,
I have accumulated quite a variety of odd tools;
among them are a varied lot of millers, for milling and
raising jewels, and deepening the countersink holes for
jewel settings and screw heads, also a tool for holding
a roller, to set the jewel pin, and one for holding the
hair spring collet, and a pair of tweezers for holding
jewels while cleaning, etc., etc. As to lathes, I have
found that there is a necessity of about two lathes;
one a Swiss, light running lathe for cementing any
pivot work, and I prefer these because they run much
lighter and easier than those heavier American lathes;
and yet if confined to but one lathe, I would use a small
sized American lathe, with a good assortment of split
chucks, particularly those with the smaller sized holes,
for holding balance staffs, wheel arbors, etc., which
come in use almost everyday, for taking off the burr
from the point of a balance pivot, which has come
from a collapse of the case; driving the end stones
down on the end of pivots, even sometimes to the extent
of heading them over inside of the hole jewel.
These small size split chucks I have found extremely
useful for the last named purpose, and I am not so
"sentimental" but that I oftener use these split chucks,
even for setting fine balance pivots, rather than take
time to cement them; and while I do not advise the
use of a split chuck for this purpose in every case, yet
with a little experience one can tell when a staff is held
so that the new pivot when set will "line" and be true,
and of a clear beat or swing. To make a very nice
pivot the cementing process is preferable, and yet, for
nearly a year, my old No. 1 American lathe was not
set up (for reasons I need not take space to explain), and
during that time I employed a very skillful workman
to do my pivoting, and this man would not think of
ever doing a nice job unless he cemented it, and I can
assure you that he put in more pivots out of line, and
out of true, in the course of those few months, than I
had done badly in my life. Speaking of "sentiment,"
I will say that too many young workmen use the lathe
too much, and seem to depend on a fine looking lathe
and handsome tools, and spend too much time in using
the lathe and in decorating their bench with a fine display.
But don&#39;t construe this as meaning that one can
<a name="Page_10605" id="Page_10605"></a>do nice work with a jack knife and handsaw, for I most
certainly believe in a good and substantial set of tools,
or I would not have taken so much space in speaking
of them. Next, one must have a good bench, wide and
of good length: and if no other drawers, a shallow depth
drawer, exactly in center of the bench, with no knob
in front, but rather a lip running its whole length, underneath.
So that wherever you place your hand you
can pull it out. This drawer I would have large and
roomy (wide and long and extending back as far as the
depth of the bench will allow, but shallow, not deep
down in), and then partition it off by narrow slats, diagonally
across it, running these slats from the extreme
near right hand corner to the further and extreme left
hand corner, so that as you reach your right hand in
to take out a tool, you can grasp it naturally without
twisting or cramping your hand. About eight inches
below the top of the bench, I would place a skin
drawer (the name comes from the practice at watch
factories, formerly using sheepskins for the bottoms),
which is made with a square frame (say like a picture
frame), sliding on slats or a groove, so that it can be
drawn out toward the operator, and when so drawn,
the elbows will rest on this frame, with the wrists resting
on the edge of the top of the bench, thus giving a
firm support for both arms and hands, and this frame
having stretched across its bottom a skin or canvas,
will catch and retain anything that drops or rolls from
the bench. This latter drawer I consider almost an indispensable
article to doing good and successful work.
At the right hand of these two drawers named, running
down to floor if need be, there can be a series of
drawers for tools and materials. Now with these equipments,
and some others, not herein named, such as vise,
file block, bench stake or anvil, and a large variety of
such tools as will accumulate, I am ready to give you
my ideas regarding the cleaning and repairing of
watches. First and foremost, do not undertake any
job that you have any or considerable doubt but what
you can do successfully, and never leave a job worse
than you found it; and never mar, cut, or slash any
part of a watch. In other words, don&#39;t undertake a
job that you have doubts as to whether you can do it
correctly. One of my old masters told me never to
undertake to improve on the maker&#39;s work, and this,
while not true in every case (particularly cheap
watches), yet is a safe rule to go by. Never allow your
file, screwdriver, pliers, tweezers, or any tool to deface
any part of a watch. I shall speak of this as I proceed.
First, be careful and not let the movement
swing so as to in any way injure the balance, in taking
from case, and if a lever watch, take out the balance
the first thing after getting out of case. Now see that
the mainspring is let down and then remove the screws
from the plates, taking care not to damage or bend
any of the pivots as you do this. When all in pieces,
before you proceed to clean, examine with a strong
glass to see if the rim of any wheel is rubbing or clashing
with anything, particularly the center wheel in any
full plate American watch, for these wheels are often
dragging on the plate or striking the ratch wheel because
it is not true, and if examined before cleaning
the places where it drags, are a tell-tale of the mischief.
Also make any diagnosis of the watch that is needed
to discover any errors from wear or accident, and correct
them before going further, such as looking to each
jewel, pivot, and other parts, and make all necessary
repairs before cleaning. I have been in the habit for
several years of putting my balance wheel separate
from all connections, and trying its freedom in all positions,
and if you will try this method, you will be surprised
how many you will find that bind or are not
perfectly free in all positions, when you give them the
very slightest impulse by a twirl of the hand, holding
the plate. Then, too, a careful examination of each
jewel; you will be surprised how many are either
loose in the setting or plate. In regard to cleaning, I
use the old method (after trying all ways suggested)&mdash;that
of chalk (but I use the old lump chalk, for those
carpenters&#39; chalk balls are made with some kind of
paste that adheres to the plate)&mdash;and have this lump of
chalk at my right hand, in a perforated bottom box,
so that any coarse pieces fall through to the floor, and
by rubbing the brush across it and then giving it a
slight rap, before applying it to plate, any hard or
heavy substance will fall out, and then with light pressure
with the brush that is medium soft (and prepared
on grindstone as before mentioned, if a new one) brush
the plates, with an occasional breathing on the surface,
clean the old oil or tarnish, and then peg out each hole
many times, until you are sure every hole is clean, by
pegging both sides, and then with a soft dust brush
dust thoroughly by striking the brush into the holes
on both sides. Of course, remove all end stones, and
clean out with soft pith, holding the jewels in a pair of
hook nose tweezers, mentioned. Should the plates
and wheels be very much soiled and oily, a covered dish
of alcohol is indispensable, and I have had a glass stopper
bottle, with ether, in which to dip the jewels, pallets,
and other small pieces, which takes the oil all off,
but be sure and clean off with soft pith or pegwood
such pieces as you have thus dipped. This ether will
carry all loose lint or other things to its bottom, from
hairsprings or roller table, and if held but a moment
will do effective work, and not loosen shellac.</p>

<p>Regarding loose jewels, I am not so sentimental as
to refuse using some shellac, if the burnished lip has
been so thin as to be partially gone, thus loosening the
jewel to hold in the jewel, by taking small and minute
particles, and placing around the edge of the jewel,
and then holding the plate or bridge over an alcohol
flame, and allowing the shellac to flow around the jewel
and fasten it firm, and by this process I have kept jewels
firm in place for years, with no other attention than
the first, and as a rule this can be done and not show.
When you have thoroughly cleaned the different parts,
holding everything with soft tissue paper, then with
the paper put the watch together, never forcing any
part into place, and when screwed or pinned together,
try every wheel to see that there is the proper end and
side shake to each pivot, then introduce the balance
wheel, having been once tried alone as described, and
see that the banking pins are so adjusted that the
guard pin on the fork (lever) does not drag on either
side, and that the jewel pin enters the slot, clearing
the opposite corner, and that the guard pin is so in
position that it will not allow the pin to pass by at any
point and bring the jewel pin outside the lever, or so it
will strike in hollow, or on the corners of the hollow of
the roller. When you have oiled each pivot exactly on
its connecting point of bearing with just the right
amount of oil (of course, oil those jewels having end
stones before putting watch together), your watch is
ready for the dial, and in replacing the hands you cannot
be too particular about their being free and clearing
each other and the dial and glass. There is the
care of the mainspring I have intentionally reserved
till the last. There are lots of theories why a spring
will break just after cleaning, but I only know that
since I have adopted the method of never taking out
the spring (except when, after taking off the cap of
barrel, I find it is all gummed up with bad oil, and
then of course clean it) I have found that a spring does
not break any oftener than is common, even if the
watch is not cleaned; but I invariably remove the barrel
arbor and clean out the holes and the arbor itself.</p>

<p>Of course to explain every detail of the method of
repairing the various parts of a watch would take more
space than you would allow in your journal, and hence
I will not attempt to go into minute detail, except perhaps
some of the more important items, and the most
common things found in everyday experience. Among
these are broken pivots, worn pivots (sometimes requiring
new ones), worn holes in plates, and at the intersection
of barrel arbor, ratch and bridge of Swiss watches,
etc., which, as a rule, require common sense as much as
practice, and it varies in different watches, so that the
common sense rule applies the best to nearly all of
these, and if you have not got common mechanical
sense, then you have mistaken your calling and should
do something else. In any of these repairs don&#39;t go it
blind, but study your case carefully and do the best
thing you study out. When there is a worn pivot hole
in a plate, and one side is countersunk for oil, then
have a punch rounded at the point, just the shape of
the countersink (and if you have not one make one, and
here is where my rule, that of making a tool as the
need comes for it, comes in play), and by screwing this
punch into the vise, and with a smooth, flat point
punch (slightly cornered of course) in one hand and
holding the plate or bridge with the other, with the
countersink on the punch, have a striker tap light and
quick blows, and you move the punch around on the
side most worn (and one side is almost invariably worn
most, throwing the wheel arbor out of upright) and
close up, even a little too much, and then with a round,
smooth broach enlarge it, so that it will be right size,
and this leaves it hard and smooth.</p>

<p>Broken pivots, as I have hinted, I place the arbor in
a split chuck, and if true, I drill into the staff with a
drill, made from a nice piece of steel wire, the old and
ordinary shape of a drill, which is a trifle larger at the
cutting point than it is back of the point, and I make
these as I need them, and harden simply by holding
the wire in a flame till red hot, and then dash into an
apple, potato, soap, or pure rubber. Which is the best
of these I have as yet been unable to determine, so I
use either as the most handy. Take a good, tough and
small pointed graver and turn a slight center in the
end of arbor I am to drill, and then by giving my lathe
a back and forward motion, I begin to drill, and by
the sense of feeling I can tell whether my drill is cutting
or not, and if not, I have a small, smooth oilstone
at hand and sharpen the drill as often as it refuses to
cut, and if that drill will not cut, I make another.</p>

<p>I make my drills of very small wire, filing them at
point and then tap the point (holding the wire in a
very fine pin vise), thus flattening as well as spreading
it, and then shape the cutting edges as spoken of
above. When you have drilled sufficiently to hold a
plug firmly, then have a piece of steel of spring temper
filed so as to fit closely and so straight that it will not
act too wedging (and split the arbor), drive it in, cut it
off and turn down, finishing with an oilstone slip, and
polish by running the lathe rapidly and with a piece of
thin boxwood (or hard pegwood) charged with diamantine,
being sure that the end of the pivot has no burr,
thrown either way, over end or on side, for such a
burr will cause a lack of freedom of a balance pivot
particularly. This matter of setting pivots requires a
longer experience than almost any other work, and it
needs a long practice to do a nice job. If your split
chuck will not hold your staff or arbor true, then use
cement; but in this, too, you must be sure that your
center is true, and that the sound pivot enters it perfectly.
Sometimes you meet with steel so hard that
you cannot touch it with a drill, in which case draw
the temper of the staff or arbor you are drilling, and
if it projects so little that you cannot draw the temper
without injury to the wheel, then unstake or separate
the wheel, and by drilling a hole into a piece of brass
wire, about the size of the staff you are drilling, insert
the staff in this hole, and then heat the wire near the
staff and thus gradually and yet effectively draw the
temper.</p>

<p>I consider it well for young workmen to practice
pivot setting in some old and useless watch any spare
time they may have, and thus become adepts at this
work. Unhindered, I am not over on an average of
one-half hour in setting any ordinary pivot, especially
if I do not have to cement my work. If this is a balance
pivot, be very careful to see that your balance is
true and poised before putting on hairspring and roller.
There are some pivots that are underturned (to make
look tidy and light), and sometimes it is about an impossibility
to put in a new one, and in this case, if an
American watch, I always put in an entire new staff,
and hence keep a full assortment on hand.</p>

<p>Regarding replacing broken jewels, I also keep a full
stock of these, turned (the setting) to match any make
or style of watch; except, of course, Swiss watches,
and for these I keep a large assortment of sizes, both of
cock and foot and wheel jewels, and a full stock once
procured, they last a long time and are a good investment,
for with them you can meet any emergency.</p>

<p>In a Swiss watch, or any watch where the jewel is set
into the plate, have some one of the devices for throwing
up the burnished lip, and then select a jewel that
just fills the space, and then with a smooth pointed
punch, such as I described I used for closing up a pivot
hole, I turn this lip back by sliding this round pointed
punch around the outside, making it act as a burnish.
Cap jewels I either treat in the same manner as the
last, or cut away the setting, and insert them as they
are inserted in most Swiss watches.</p>

<p>I have now taken up the more common repairs, and
will close by hastily speaking of the more rare cases,
and the adjustment of the hair spring, etc., etc. It is
often the case that there is never end shake to the balance
to make it absolutely safe when screwed into the
case, and when this happens I take the point of a sharp
graver and prick up a burr on the bridge, and never
on the plate, as any unskilled workman does, for the
under side of the bridge never being finished, you really
mar nothing, and sometimes this raising of the cock
(or bridge) becomes a necessity, to have it clear the rim
of the balance, which, if raised, it will clear, and then
by bending down the end of the cock at point where
the jewel is, and thus regulate the end shake. I hardly
know how to give directions how to proceed in adjusting
hairsprings, when they are disarranged, but if I
could see you, I could explain by example what I cannot
well do in words. To commence, a hairspring, when
there is no power applied to balance from the jewel
pin, should be, when pinned, just as free from any
twist or cramping as it would be if lying flat and free
on a smooth piece of glass, before it has been pinned
at either end, and when it is pinned in the watch (at
stud and collet) it should be thus free. To bring it thus
requires demonstration that cannot be made on paper,
unless you could make diagrams, too numerous for this
article.</p>

<p>What I have said regarding it, however, gives an idea
of how a hairspring should be pinned. Common sense is
demanded here as elsewhere. To put a watch in beat,
too, is a very important item, which I do by placing
sharp pointed tweezers, first on one side of the arm of
balance and then on the other, and so pin my hairspring
in the stud, that it will let off as readily on one
side as the other. I had forgotten to say that every
watch should have a little oil on the face of the pallet
stones. I know full well that some workmen will say
that there should be none, but I can tell of scores of
watches that have failed and indeed stopped simply for
want of oil on the pallets. Selecting mainsprings, too,
needs much more care than is usually given to this department,
and as a rule even the watch factories fill
the barrel too full, that is, too long springs. Whether
I am correct in this or not, you cannot be too particular
in selecting the right strength, length, and width of
mainsprings. Mainsprings should be well and carefully
oiled.</p>

<p>There are many ways of replacing broken teeth in
wheels, and the width of the web and the size of the
teeth has much to do with how they are put in, but I
usually dovetail them in, and then with the very tiniest
bit of soft solder fasten them, but in so doing be
positive you have got off all soldering fluid, that it will
not rust the pinion into which it meshes, and be very
particular to have it exactly like the rest of the teeth
in same wheel, and don&#39;t mar the web of the wheel
more than is possible.</p>

<p>I will now draw this article to a close, well appreciating
the fact that I have only made a superficial attempt
to instruct younger men in the cleaning and repairing
of watches, for there is almost an endless variety of
special repairs coming almost unexpectedly to any one,
even if they have been in the business a long time, as I
have, and as I first said, I am learning daily some new
phase of the business, and am surprised that I never
had known it before. I have, too, taken perhaps more
space than I ought, regarding tools and bench, yet the
older I grow, the more I can see the importance of this
part, that I may be enabled to do work well and quick.
Besides, I have left such repairs as the chain and fusee,
uprighting wheels, repairing cases, adjustment to position,
heat and cold, isochronism, enlarging jewels, or
changing angles of pallet stones, etc., etc., all of which
I do as necessity demands, as well as the care of striking
watches, fly backs, etc., which, too, I make a
specialty of, and of chronometer escapement watches,
which would take more space than I feel disposed to
ask you to give me.&mdash;<i>American Jeweler</i>.</p>

<h2><a name="art02" id="art02"></a>
THE NEW CENTRAL RAILWAY STATION AT
FRANKFORT ON THE MAIN.</h2>


<p>The new central railway station at Frankfort on the
Main is one of the most imposing structures of modern
times, not only as regards its dimensions, but also because
of the effect which its architectural proportions
produce upon the eye. Nobody looking at the long line
of buildings surrounded by gigantic perron halls can
help being impressed with their grandeur. The beholder,
however, is not only struck by the general aspect, but
also by the beauty of detail in this magnificent specimen
of the Renaissance style. The interior of the perron hall
shown in one of our engravings is especially impressive,
and every one will admire the graceful outlines of the
heavy iron structures in the upper part, which, in consequence
of their enormous height, look from below like
a spider web.</p>

<p>The base and the earth works were begun in the
summer of 1881, and if we take into consideration the
fact that 2,700,000 cubic meters of sand and gravel
were necessary for the foundation, we will have some
idea of the scale on which the edifice was undertaken.
In 1883, the great hall, which has a width of 220 meters
and which will shortly be opened to traffic, was begun.
The perspective view of this portion of the station is
given in one of our engravings. Inspector Eggert
had the general management of the building, which
was erected after the plan submitted by him, and which
received the prize in the competition between the different
architects. Herr Frantz, a distinguished engineer,
who undertook the general supervision of the
construction, had an important part in the execution
of the entrance hall for the trains, and it was he, also,
who built the perron hall, after designs of Herr
Schwedler.</p>

<p>The middle part of the station, which contains the
porch, the ticket offices, the baggage department, the
police quarters and the telegraph offices, projects, as
shown in the picture, considerably beyond the rest of
the building, and by the distinct membering of its
moulding stands out conspicuously from the whole.
Protruding portals of peculiar structure and corner
pavilions enliven the aspect of the wings of the edifice,
the great round arched windows of which are separated
from each other by powerful stone pillars. The corner
pavilions to the left in the view contain the so-called
imperial apartments for the reception of royal travelers,
and on the other side are the meeting hall and reception
rooms of the different railway administrations.
On the right and left of the imposing main vestibule,
which is distinguished by the strength and the beauty
of its style, lobbies with arched roofs lead to the waiting
and dining rooms, the ladies&#39; rooms, the imperial
apartments and the above mentioned meeting hall of
the administration.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;"><a name="Page_10606" id="Page_10606"></a>

</a><span class="caption">THE NEW CENTRAL RAILWAY STATION. FRANKFORT ON THE MAIN.<br />&mdash;
Drawn by Fr. Schurmann.</span>
</div>

<p><a name="Page_10607" id="Page_10607"></a>The ladies&#39; and gentlemen&#39;s toilet rooms also are in
that part of the building.</p>

<p>The architect has laid especial stress upon the architectural
ornamentation of the building. Upon the apex
of the arch over the main vestibule a great group will
be placed, representing Atlas carrying the world on his
shoulders, and supported in his work by the allegorical
figures of Steam and Electricity.</p>

<p>This group, which is at the present moment being
executed in copper by Houwald, in Brunswick, is the
work of a Frankfort sculptor, Herr Gustav Herold. In
the arch itself, near the clock, we see two allegorical
female figures, over life size, in a sitting posture, modeled
by Prof. Gustav Kaupert in Frankfort, and representing
Day and Night. In front of the pillars supporting
the arch, two other female sitting figures, also
above life size, will be perceived. These were modeled
by Professor Calandrelli in Berlin, and represent Agriculture
and Commerce, and in the niches on both sides
there are the statues of Navigation and Industry, the
work of the sculptor Hundrieser, of Berlin. The two
side portals of the entrance hall are surmounted by
figures of boys, having a height 2.40 meters; on the left
the commercial traveler and traveling student, modelled
by Rudolph Eckhardt in Frankfort; on the right
the traveler for pleasure and the emigrant, the works
of the sculptor Scholl, of Mayence. The groups of the
corner pavilions, allegoric representations of machine
building and engineering, were modeled by Professor
Max Wiese, of Hanau. The figures, like the whole
building, are of Heibronn sandstone. Either wing has
a vestibule leading to the middle perron of the great
hall. They resemble in style the architecture of the front
of the middle building, only their arches are smaller.
Here also we meet rich architectural ornamentation
on the pillars in the great arch. The ornaments consist,
as in the former case, of allegorical figures of boys.
They have a height of 2.20 meters, and represent Agriculture
and Art Industry on the one side and Art and
the Retail Trade of Frankfort on the other side. The
two former figures are the work of the sculptor A. Brutt,
of Berlin; the two latter were modeled by Hermann
Becker, of Frankfort. The side facades are very long,
but of simpler style than the front of the building, and
connect with the perron halls, which on their part end
in semi-towers. There the offices of the administrations
are located. The main vestibule leads directly to the
middle of the perron in the large hall, which consists
of three naves, and into which enter the trains of six
railway lines, each separated from the other by perrons.
The perron hall has a length of 186 meters and a width
of 168 meters. The height of the naves, with their
low arched roofs, rises in the center to 28.5 meters.
Tunnels connect the different railway lines, in
order to assist the rapid transit of through trains.
The port also benefits by these tunnels. The inside
front of the main vestibule is very richly decorated.
In its center a large clock is situated, and on
both sides of it are colossal allegorical figures modeled
by F. Kruger, of Frankfort, and representing the
hours of Morning and Evening, while on the pillars
we perceive large male figures in a sitting posture, representing
the Defense of the Country and Mining, the
work of Herr Keller, of Frankfort. The pillars are
crowned by groups of sculpture, representing the
Honeymoon Travel and Instruction in Traveling, the
one modeled by A. C. Rumpf, and the other by Friedrich
Schierholz, of Frankfort.</p>

<p>The whole edifice is fire proof, scarcely any wood having
been used in its erection. The hall as well as the
other parts of the building are heated by steam and
lighted by electricity. The whole cost of the structure
amounted to about $8,500,000.&mdash;<i>Illustrirte Zeitung</i>.</p>

<h2><a name="art01" id="art01"></a>
THE COMMERCIAL EXCHANGE, PARIS.</h2>

<p>At the beginning of the year 1881, the committee on
finances of the common council of Paris received a petition
from the central committee of the syndical
chambers asking for the establishment of an official
exchange for merchandise and commercial transactions
for the especial use of Parisian commerce. To this
petition was added a project of organization which
proposed the appropriation of the grain market, with
a clearing of the approaches. The Paris chamber of
commerce had likewise been for a long time contemplating
the establishment of a merchandise exchange,
and was studying the practical means of organizing it.</p>

<p>Called upon to decide, the common council, at its
session of May 28, 1881, decreed that an official merchandise
exchange for the commerce of Paris should be
organized, and that the grain market, or any other
place considered favorable by the administration,
should be appropriated.</p>

<p>Desirous of aiding in carrying out this decree, the
chamber of commerce offered its services to the city.
It proposed to take upon itself the responsibility of
organizing and managing the exchange, and of borrowing
the money necessary for converting the grain market
into a merchandise exchange, and for clearing the
approaches and opening Louvre Street.</p>

<p>The study of this project soon became connected,
by reason of the proximity of the places, with the one
having for its object the enlarging of the central markets
and the construction of two pavilions to complete
them. It was recognized that it would be of interest
to make the appropriation necessary for the enlarging
of the markets and to unite the two operations.
After many vicissitudes, this project received the approval
of the common council.</p>

<br /><span class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 1.&mdash;EXTERNAL VIEW OF THE COMMERCIAL EXCHANGE OF PARIS.</span>
</div>

<p>The contract for the work was given on the 2d of
March, 1886, to Mr. Blondel, the well known architect.</p>

<p>Let us now see how the contract has been followed
out. The grain market was built in 1767, upon the site
of the hotel of Soissons. Of this, nothing was preserved
but the astronomical tower of Catherine de
Medicis, which still remains. The central part of the
market left free was soon covered with a wooden framework,
which was destroyed by fire in 1802. This was
then replaced by the architect Brunet with an iron
cupola covered with sheet copper. This market was
designed for the reception of the grain and flour
necessary to supply the city, but was soon supplanted
by public granaries, and then by general stores. It
afterward became a depot in which grain and flour
brokers received merchandise from shippers in order to
effect a sale of it. The abolition of the <i>factorat</i> gave
it its last blow.</p>

<p>Let us examine the transformations made by Mr.
Blondel in the old structure. He began by excavating
under the entire extent of the market a basement 13
ft. in depth. The old foundations of the circular walls,
which are more than 6 ft. thick, and which are extremely
solid, extend to a depth of about 2&frac12; ft. beneath
the surface. The ceiling of the basement, in the
annular part between the walls, is formed of large T
iron girders, resting upon the circular walls. These
support transverse girders, which, in turn, support the
floor irons.</p>

<p>The flooring of the hall is formed of ordinary floor
irons, assembled upon large girders, which are supported
here and there by cast iron columns. Under
this flooring there is a second one, leaving a free space
of about ten inches, in which will be placed the tubes
serving for ventilation. To these pipes will be joined
vertical ones debouching in the flooring of the hall.</p>

<p>The old dome did not have apertures enough, and
the skylight even was not transparent, and so the lighting
of the hall was very defective. The mode of covering
the dome was therefore completely modified. The
copper was removed, and upon the old framework was
laid a wooden framework, to which will be nailed laths
designed to receive a slate roof. The slate will not extend
to the summit of the dome, but will leave above
it a spherical cap, which will be glazed, and through
which the light will enter the hall in abundance.</p>

</div>

<p>In the basement will be installed the ventilating and
heating apparatus. Another part of the basement
will be occupied by the dynamo machines that are to
furnish the electric light. Another part will receive
the bake ovens that belong to the laboratory of the
committee on grain and flour. The rest of the basement
will be rented. The central part will probably
be converted into a cold room for the preservation of
early fruit and vegetables.</p>

<p>On the ground floor, we find, in the first place, the
rooms that the contractor is to furnish gratuitously for
post office, telegraph, and telephones, and to licensed
brokers, and especially a hall of superb dimensions designed
for the public sale of raw materials by the
brokers.</p>

<p>What remains of the ground floor will be devoted to
offices looking at once upon the hall and Viarones
Street. The entresol and the two stories will be connected
by several staircases. The various stories will
also be reached through elevators. A circular balcony
will extend around the hall at the level of each of the
two upper stories. These will be occupied by offices
smaller than those on the ground floor, which will,
some of them, get their light from the hall, and others
from the street.</p>

<p>A part of the second story will be reserved for the
<a name="Page_10608" id="Page_10608"></a>service of the committees on grain and flour, who, as
experts, are called upon to determine to what type
each specimen is to be referred.</p>

<p>From the exchange, let us pass to the annexes. The one
on the right is destined to become a large hotel for the
accommodation of provincial and foreign merchants.
The one to the left will be a tenement house, with
shops and apartments. Along each of these annexes,
on Viarones Street, will extend a covered colonnade.&mdash;<i>Abstract

<h2><a name="art08" id="art08"></a>A BASIS FROM WHICH TO CALCULATE
CHARGES FOR ELECTRIC MOTOR SERVICE.<a name="FNanchor_A_2" id="FNanchor_A_2"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_A_2" class="fnanchor">1</a></h2>

<p>The theoretical side of the electric motor question
has been very ably presented to and discussed by this
association, but thus far the practical side has been
somewhat neglected.</p>

<p>It will be my purpose in this paper, if possible, to
show that there is a general average controlling the use
of machinery which it will be safe for electric light and
power companies to follow in making their charges for
motor service, rather than adopt an arbitrary price per
horse power regardless of the character of service required
of the motor.</p>

<p>I have arranged what might be called a power curve,
representing the approximate average actual service in
electric motors in connection with the several classes
of work represented in the list accompanying the diagram.</p>

<p>This curve is calculated on motors which are only of
sufficient capacity in each case to carry the full load.
If the motor should be larger than is necessary to drive
the machinery, the percentage of actual service will, of
course, drop below that shown in the diagram.</p>

<p>By adopting a basis of averages which shall be general
among members of this association, the charges
for a constant horse power of current may vary with
the circumstances of its first cost in each case, but the
general classification of motor service may be a comparatively
fixed rule. I am not prepared to say that
this is the best plan to follow, but respectfully submit
the following as a possible solution of the frequently
asked question, "How shall we charge for electric
motor service?"</p>


<h3>EXHAUST FANS.</h3>

<p>First on the list of power consumers is the exhaust
fan, taking it in average use. There are, however,
circumstances under which its use will be limited to
as low as 70 or 75 per cent. of its contract hours of
service. As, for instance, in a dining room it may be
cut out except during meal hours, or entirely cut out
on cool days. In places of this description, however,
its contract use is usually limited to five or six months
in the year, and other than electric power is, by circumstances
of first cost and inconvenience, but a feeble
competitor.</p>

<p>The first four applications on the accompanying list,
viz., exhaust fans, blowers, ceiling fans, and fan outfits,
are all more or less subject to the foregoing conditions,
and therefore currents supplied to motors for these
purposes command the maximum price per horse power.
One important feature in the installation of ceiling fans
is the countershafting to the motor. In one recent
case we had a complaint from a customer that the half
horse power motor sent him would not drive the ceiling
fans, and that the motor must be defective, and should
he return it for repairs. We immediately sent a representative
to find out the difficulty, which was found,
as is usual in such cases, in the countershafting, or rather
the want of it. The 3 in. pulley on the motor
was connected to a 6 in. pulley on the line shafting.
The rated speed of the motor was 2,000 revolutions, and
had it been able to develop this speed, would have
driven the line shaft 1,000 revolutions and the fans a
relative speed. To accomplish this would probably require
a motor of 3 or 4 H.&nbsp;P. The line shafting driving
ceiling fans usually runs about 75 revolutions. To give
this speed on the line shaft with a rated speed of 2,000
on the 3 in. pulley of the motor would require a
countershaft with a 24 in. pulley belted to the motor.
On the same countershaft should be a 5 in. pulley
belted to a 15 or 16 in. pulley on the line shaft. Fully
three-fourths of the trouble found in electric motors
arises from improper shafting and belting. The average
make of 30 in. exhaust wheel, a &frac12; H.&nbsp;P. motor
should drive about 400 revolutions. Say, then, the
speed of the motor is 2,000 and the pulley 3 in., it would
require a 15 in. pulley on the fan to do the work. A 36
in. wheel requires 1 H.&nbsp;P. to develop the same speed.
If the motor speed is 1,800, the pulley 4 in., it would require
an 18 in. pulley on the fan to do the work. These
are the most popular sizes of exhaust wheels.</p>

<p>The next application on the list, open tank elevator
pumps, commands the highest price for current per
H.&nbsp;P. in the motor of any elevator application. The
methods of operating the open tank hydraulic elevators
in question are undoubtedly familiar to you all. Instead
of the usual steam pump, a power pump of some
approved design is substituted, and connected to the
motor by suitable countershafting to give the required
revolutions at the pump. The regulation of the motor
in this case should be controlled by the position of
water in the lower tank, as in the case of the steam
pump. And in this connection let me suggest the necessity
of great care, both in installation and insulation.</p>

<p>On all installations in basements and cellars or elsewhere
where there is the slightest tendency to dampness,
raise the motor off the floor on a suitable frame
or stand and build around it on all sides of possible
approach a low platform, using glass insulators as legs
or standards to support it. So arrange this that the
motor or its connections cannot be reached except
when standing on this insulated platform, and the liability
to a shock will be reduced to the difference of
potential between the terminals of the machine. To
return to the subject. Let us take for an illustration an
elevator using 120 gallons of water per trip and consuming
one minute in making its entire up trip or
about two per round trip. The lower tank or water
supply is on a level with the pump. The upper tank
is 70 ft. above the pump, and in the piping to the upper
tank are five elbows. For each elbow add 2 ft. to
the elevation, or an approximate total elevation of 80
ft. &times; 120 gallons gives us 9,600 foot gallons. This amount
would be required every two minutes if the elevator
was in absolutely constant operation, or 4,800 foot gallons
per minute &times; 8&frac12; gives us 40,800 foot pounds. This
we must at least double to allow for friction in pump
shafting, etc., making 81,600 foot pounds, or about 2&frac12;
H.&nbsp;P., say 3 required in the motor.</p>

<p>This class of elevator is confined almost entirely to
passenger use. Therefore the service required of the
motor is much more constant and the margin between
the H.&nbsp;P. hours contracted for and the H.&nbsp;P. hours of
actual service much smaller than in any other elevator
use, excepting possibly the services in connection with
pressure tank elevators in the more popular office buildings.
In this case we have a maximum average use of
80, and instances such as the hotels, small office buildings,
etc., where the service will not exceed 60 of the
contract H.&nbsp;P. hours. In order, however, that the electric
light company shall derive the greatest benefit from
this inconstant service, the installation and wiring
should be the best, and only the most approved and
economical apparatus employed.</p>

<p>The next application on our list, pressure tank pumps
in connection with elevators, represents a somewhat
smaller percentage of H.&nbsp;P. hours of actual service in
the motor as compared with the possible H.&nbsp;P. hours
than in the case of an open tank pump. In case of
the pressure tank the water reserve is usually limited,
and the motor therefore must be equal to the continuous
operation of the elevator at maximum load. Taking
this fact into consideration, and the circumstances
of elevator use being about the same in this case as in
the case of the open tank elevator, we have a greater
ratio of difference between the possible or contract
H.&nbsp;P. hours in the motor and the H.&nbsp;P. hours of actual
service, the maximum average use being about 70 per
cent. to 75 per cent. and the minimum as low as 35
per cent. to 40 per cent., depending, of course, on
the character of building in which the elevator
is employed or the character of service. In calculating
the size of motor required on an elevator of
this description, a very convenient fact to remember is
that every pound of pressure per square inch is equivalent
to lifting water about 23 ft., or about 230 ft. per
100 pounds pressure, By reducing the required pressure
to a relative lift in feet, and knowing the amount
of water required by the elevator per minute, the motor
calculation becomes the same as in case of the open
tank elevator, the same allowances being made for friction,
etc., as in the first case. The regulation of the
motor in this case should be accomplished by the conditions
of pressure in the pressure tank, as is the case
with a steam pump employed in this service.</p>

<p>The next application of importance on the list is
sewing machines. In the tests I have been able to
make on this class of work I have obtained some singular
results. One item of importance is the fact that
the single thread machines, which are lightest running,
consume the most power in operating. Paradoxical as
this may seem, it is easily explained. As a rule this
class of machine is used on light work, such as shirts,
ladies&#39; underwear, etc., and operated at a higher speed
than any other class of machine. At equal speed the
volts consumed on a single thread machine as compared
with a shuttle machine is about as 2 to 3. In average
commercial use, however, the positions are reversed,
and the ratio of volts consumed in the single thread
as compared with the shuttle machine is about as 5 to
3. To double the speed on a sewing machine requires
about 2&frac12; times the power. The difference in volts
consumed on the different makes of sewing machines
is so small that we may disregard it entirely, as well as
the character of work done by the machine, for the
heavier the work the slower the speed, and more frequent
and longer stops on the machine, thus keeping
the average volts per operator about constant in all
cases. This leaves the speed in stitches per minute at
the sewing machine the factor from which we must
calculate the power required in a sewing machine plant.
To illustrate this I will give you the record of two
cases which are about the average. Case No. 1 is a
shop in which are 30 sewing machines connected to a
2 H.&nbsp;P. motor. At the time tests were made there were
but twenty operators at work, leaving ten idle machines,
the entire shafting, however, being in operation.
The class of goods manufactured in this shop is a cheap
grade of cotton and wool pants, rather heavy goods to
sew. A volt meter across the terminals of the motor
gave the following readings with the current at 9 amperes:
Minimum 90 volts, maximum 148 volts, average
119, which gives us a minimum average per operator of
4.5 volts and a maximum average of 7.4 volts, or a general
average of 5.9 volts per operator. This motor was
driving the shafting for 30 machines, and as the average
operators employed the year round will not exceed
75 per cent. of the shop capacity, it will, I think, be
entirely fair to estimate the average volts per machine
rather than per operator, as the user of the motor has
contracted for power sufficient to drive his entire plant.
In this case, then, we have a minimum average of 3
volts per machine and a maximum of 4.9 volts, or a
general average of say 4 volts per machine. A 2 horse
motor of 82 per cent. efficiency with 9 amperes of current
will require about 200 volts to develop 2 actual
H.&nbsp;P. Two hundred volts therefore is what the electric
light company contract to deliver, while, in reality,
they deliver only 129 volts or 60 percent., or a minimum
average of 90 volts or 45 per cent. of the power contracted
for. These machines were making about 1,200
stitches per minute&mdash;an average of 4 volts per 100
stitches.</p>

<p>Case No. 2 is a shop in which there are 32 machines,
running about 1,200 stitches, each being supplied with
an individual motor of 1/8 H.&nbsp;P. capacity, and the class
of goods manufactured being men&#39;s summer clothing,
such as white duck vests, flannel coats and vests, etc.,
the duck from which these vests are made being
about as hard work on a sewing machine as can be
found. In this shop were 24 operators at work. The
maximum volts in this case were 116 and the minimum
40, or general average of but 78 volts, or about
2&frac12; volts per machine with 4 more operators than in
the first case, in which we had an average of 119 volts.
This shop has been paying the electric light company
$32 per month for more than a year, which is the price the
company charge for current for a 4 H.&nbsp;P. motor which
approximates 400 volts, the company contracts to deliver.
This gives us a minimum average use of but 10
per cent. and a maximum of 29 per cent. with a general
average of 19&frac12; per cent. In other words, the company
is saving in this shop the price of a 1/8 H.&nbsp;P. motor each
month, besides making a profit on the volts actually
delivered. On a contract for three years the electric
light company would be money in pocket if they
would present the customer with 30 small motors,
charging him $1 per month per motor for current, rather
than let him buy a 2 H.&nbsp;P. motor to operate the
same machines with the necessary shafting at a charge
of $18 per month for current. Taking this average in
case No. 2 of 2&frac12; volts per machine, from a 50 light machine,
we could run not less than 900 sewing machines,
or about 18 to the arc lamp. At $1 per month per
machine an income of $900 per month would be derived
from a 50 light machine without any lamp expenses,
such as carbons, repairs on lamps, globes, etc.
On the average, in case No. 1, of 4 volts per machine, we
could operate but about 562, say 600 machines. Divided
up in shops of 30 machines and a 2 H.&nbsp;P. motor to each
shop, we would have 20 two H.&nbsp;P. motors. At a charge
of $18 per month each, we would have an earning capacity
of but $360 per month from the same 50 light
machine.</p>

<p>This is but one page from the thus far unwritten history
of the much maligned small motor. Still the
question is frequently asked, "Can we sell current
for $1 per month for a small motor driving a sewing
machine and make a profit?" As a matter of fact, 50
cents per month for small motors driving sewing machines
yields a better profit to the company supplying
the current than $10 per month per H.&nbsp;P. in large motors
to drive the same machines, besides the immense
advantage which the small motors possess of keeping
the circuit in much better balance, the fluctuations due
to the stopping and starting of large motors being at
times a serious matter. One electric light company,
making rather a specialty of these small machines,
rent the motor and supply the current for $1.25 per
month per sewing machine, and report that at this
price the motor pays them a better percentage of profit
than their lamps. This company have some 200 small
motors on their circuits.</p>

<p>A more striking illustration of the advantages to the
electric light company in the subdivision of power
into the smallest possible units it would be hard to
find. There is a difference in efficiency of from 15 to
20 per cent. in these two sizes of motors, but this difference
is fully lost to the large motor in driving the
shafting, and the small motor still has the advantage
of being out of circuit entirely when the machine it is
driving is stopped. There is scarcely a manufacturing
industry which does not possess its busy and dull
seasons. This means that in no industry will over 75
per cent. of the machines or machinery employed be
in average operation. The entire shafting in the shops
must be kept in operation the entire year, often for less
than 50 per cent. of the machinery. Subdivide these
same shops into as many small units as possible, and the
current necessary to operate the shafting for this idle
machinery will be saved, besides the saving from frequent
stops while the machinery is in active use.</p>

<p>To return again to the list, the next two applications,
picture frame manufacturers and moulding manufacturers,
are very similar. Their busy seasons, as a rule,
are in the spring and fall, and also follow closely any
activity in house building. In the case of the larger
manufacturers in this line, a maximum average of 75
per cent. will possibly be reached, but probably never
exceeded. In the case, however, of the picture dealer
who has a small shop in which he makes picture
frames and mouldings to order the actual service of the
motor will fall as low as 25 per cent. or 30 per cent. of
its contract hours, one case in our experience the
actual service having reached this low average. A fair
general average in this class of works would be about
60 per cent.</p>

<p>The next application, nickel and silver platers and
buffers, are good contract customers as a rule; one case
in our experience showing but an average use of 20 per
cent. of the contract horse power hours. This, however,
is probably an exceptional case, and, as near as we
can estimate on this class of work, the actual motor
service will not exceed in any case 60 per cent. of the
contract hours; a fair average being probably 45 or
50 per cent.</p>

<p>The next two applications, printing presses on news
and job work, are probably met with more frequently
than any other. On exclusively news work, the instances
where the motor is in service more than 3 or 4
hours is rare. It is, however, usual in news offices to
find two or more job presses. If the newspaper printed
happens to be a morning paper, the hours of news
work are usually between 12 midnight and 4 o&#39;clock in
the morning, the job work being done through the
day. I have in mind a case of this description. In
the shop is one cylinder press and three job presses
connected to a 2 H.&nbsp;P. motor. This motor is on an incandescent
circuit of 110 volts. To develop its rated
power at 110 volts would require about 16 amperes in
the motor. An ampere motor in series with the motor
while running off the morning paper with only the
cylinder press in operation stood at 12 amperes. For
3 hours this load was practically constant, when it was
thrown off entirely. This gave on the night service
but 30 per cent. of the contract hours. This motor required
5 amperes to drive the shafting, and but 8 amperes
or one H.&nbsp;P. to drive the three job presses with
the cylinder press off. Here then is but a 50 per cent.
use if the presses be used constantly; there are, however,
many days when they are comparatively idle, 30 to 40
per cent., therefore, is a very safe estimate of the maximum
use of this motor on the day circuit, or, had the
motor been a 1 H.&nbsp;P., which would have been sufficient
to drive the job presses, the use would be 60 to 80
per cent. of the contract hours, probably not above 60
per cent. All printing offices will probably come within
this range, unless the motor be larger than is necessary
to do the work.</p>

<p>Machine shops doing principally lathe work as a
matter of course use a larger percentage of their contracted
power than shops doing lathe and bench work
with the same hands. In no case will the service of the
motor exceed 65 or 70 per cent. of its contract use, for
machine shops, like sewing machine shops, will never
average over 75 per cent. of the shop capacity for operators
the year round. The average, especially in the
case of a shop doing much bench work, will fall as low
as 40 per cent.</p>

<p>The driving of laundry machinery, which is our next
application, usually proves a profitable contract, according
to reports. This fact arises from the intermittent
use of the machinery. The heaviest service on
motor will probably be found during the early part of
each week, with a general falling off in work during
<a name="Page_10609" id="Page_10609"></a>the summer months, while the patrons of the laundry
are away at the sea-shore or in the mountains. In this
application, therefore, a 75 per cent. service would probably
be an exception, with, probably, many instances
where the service would fall below 50 per cent.</p>

<p>The next application, model and pattern makers, are
small users of power, as their occupation requires a
large proportion of hand work. 50 per cent. service in
the motor will be found a fair average maximum use,
with instances as low as 20 or 25 per cent.</p>

<p>The next application, direct power or belt elevators,
is another application frequently met. The average
service in the motor is also much smaller than in any
other elevator application. Let us suppose a case of
the familiar grip connected to the ordinary hand hoist,
with a lifting capacity of 2,000 pounds. In this case the
motor is in use only going up, and the usual brake is
used in coming down. Connected to this elevator, in
the loft of the building, we have a 5 H.&nbsp;P. motor
wired to a cut-out on the ground floor. We will call
the lift 45 feet and the time consumed per trip 1 minute.
We will allow 60 full trips of the elevator at full load,
at 2,000 lb. per trip, each day. This would approximate
10 car loads of merchandise handled by the elevator,
which is certainly above the average. This motor,
we will say, is on a ten hour day circuit. Its possible
horse power hours, therefore, would be 5 H.&nbsp;P. for 10
hours, or 50 H.&nbsp;P. hours per day. 60 trips of 1 minute
each gives us exactly 1 hour&#39;s service of the full 5 H.&nbsp;P.
or 5 H.&nbsp;P. hours. To drive the shafting only while the
elevator is coming down or idle would require about
150 volts or 1&frac12; H.&nbsp;P., and if this was in constant operation
the balance of the day, 9 hours, its total use on
shafting would be 13&frac12; H.&nbsp;P. hours, which, added to
the 5 H.&nbsp;P. hours, gives us a grand total of 18&frac12; H.&nbsp;P.
hours, or 37 per cent. of the contract hours. If, however,
the user of the motor avails himself of the cut-out
box, and cuts the current out when the motor is
not in use, the average use would drop to 20 or 25 per
cent., instead of 37 per cent. In the case of a direct
power passenger elevator, the use might possibly run
up to 60 per cent., but this would be exceptional.</p>

<p>Coffee mills will average from 40 to 60 per cent. of
their contract hours, manufacturing jewelers about
the same, while retail jewelers will run as low as 25
per cent. Ice cream freezers will not average over 25
per cent., but as the contract season in this case is
usually short, they should be rated at least a 50 per
cent. basis, except possibly in cases where the customer
pays the cost of installation and wiring, which is usual
in these cases.</p>

<p>A dentist is one of the smallest of power users, so
small, in fact, that if every one in a city were connected
with a circuit, the load from this cause would
never be felt. We will, however, put them down at
from 10 to 20 per cent.</p>

<p>The optician uses a motor to turn his grind stones,
and its use in this case will average from 20 to 30 per
cent.</p>

<p>The last application on the list&mdash;church organs&mdash;uses
only from 10 to 20 per cent. of the contract service.</p>

<p>These are, of course, but few of the very many applications
of the electric motor, and if, as I trust, the
possible subsequent discussion of this general plan
may establish a basis for rating motor applications,
not only will the objects of this paper be obtained, but
a question of considerable annoyance now existing between
the motor man and the electric light or power
company will be solved.</p>

<p>In conclusion, Mr. Chairman, I beg to suggest that
the supply and rates of charge for electric power have
become of sufficient importance to this association to
be represented by a permanent committee, whose duty
it should be to obtain from the different members of
the association, as far as possible, their experience in
the supply of power in such manner and form as shall
be deemed by the committee best suited to the wants
of this association.</p>

<p>Abyssinian women have an extraordinary head of
hair. The hair, though not very long, is very bushy,
so that it takes the capillary artist no less than a day
to succeed in reducing this forest into a small bulk.
As it requires some force to draw the comb through
the hair, the operation is painful, and this is why the
Abyssinian women have it performed every forty or
fifty days only. The Abyssinian women of rank pass
their life in almost complete idleness, occupied almost
exclusively in bedecking themselves and in making or
receiving calls. It is not the same with the women of
the people. They have many labors to perform, and
are the ones who manipulate the grains, hydromel and
beer, and grind pepper in the <i>matt-biett</i>. This latter
operation is very painful, and so they take the
precaution to first close the nostrils with plugs of cotton.

HOW A MOUND WAS BUILT.</h2>

<p>"While exploring mounds in Ohio this season, under
the direction of the National Bureau of Ethnology,"
says Mr. Gerard Fowke, in a paper prepared for <i>Science</i>,
"I used great care in the examination of one
mound in Pike County, in order to ascertain, if possible,
the exact method of its construction.</p>

<p>"The mound was built upon the site of a house,
which had probably been occupied by those whose
skeletons were found. The roof had been supported by
side posts, and at intervals by additional inner posts.
The outer posts were arranged in pairs a few inches
apart, then an interval of about three feet, then two
more, and so on. They were all about eight inches in
diameter, and extended from two and a half to three
feet into the ground, except one a few feet from the
center, which went down fully five feet. All the holes
were filled with the loose dark dirt which results from
decay of wood; a few contained fragments of charcoal,
burned bones or stone, but no ashes; nor was the surrounding
earth at all burned.</p>

<p>"Around the outside a trench from three to four feet
wide, and from eighteen to twenty inches deep, had
been dug, to carry away the water which fell from the
roof. Near the middle of this house, which measured
about forty feet from side to side, a large fire had been
kept burning for several hours, the ashes being removed
from time to time. The ash bed was elliptical
in form, measuring about thirteen feet from east to
west, and five from north to south. Under the center
of it was a hole, ten inches across and a foot deep, filled
with clean white ashes in which was a little charcoal,
packed very hard. At the western end, on the south
side (or farthest from the center of the house), was a
mass of burned animal bones, ashes, and charcoal.
This was continuous with the ash bed, though apparently
not a part of it. The bones were in small pieces,
and were, no doubt, the remains of a funeral feast or
offering.</p>

<p>"After the fire died down, rude tools were used to
dig a grave at the middle of the house. It measured
ten feet in length, from east to west, by a little more
than six in breadth. The sides were straight, slanting
inward, with rounded corners. The bottom was nearly
level, fourteen inches deep, but slightly lower at the
center. Over the bottom, ashes had been thinly
sprinkled, and on these a single thickness of bark had
been laid. The sides had been lined with wood or bark
from two to four inches thick. When this was done,
two bodies were placed side by side in the grave, both
extended at full length on the back, with heads directly
west. One, judging from the bones and condition of
the teeth, was a woman of considerable age. She was
placed in the middle of the grave. Her right arm lay
along the side, the left hand being under the pelvic
bones of the other skeleton. This was apparently of a
man not much, if any, past maturity. The right arm
lay across the stomach, the left across the hips. This
skeleton was five feet ten inches in length; the other,
five feet four inches.</p>

<p>"The space between the first skeleton and the south
side of the grave was covered with the ashes that had
been removed from the fire. Beginning at the feet in a
thin layer&mdash;a mere streak&mdash;they gradually increased in
thickness toward the head, where they were fully six
inches thick. The head was embedded in them. They
extended to the end of the grave, reaching across its
entire width and coming almost, but not quite, in contact
with the other head. A considerable amount of
the burned bones lay in the southwestern corner of the
grave, and the ashes along this part curved up over the
side until they merged into what remained of the ash
bed. This had extended to the west slightly beyond
the end of the grave.</p>

<p>"As the earth removed from the grave had been
thrown out on every side, the bodies were in a hole
that was nearly two feet deep. The next step was to
cover them. There was no sign of bark, cloth, or any
other protecting material above them. They were
covered with a black sandy earth, which must have
been brought from the creek not far distant. This was
piled over them while wet, or at least damp enough to
pack firmly, as it required the pick to loosen it, and,
besides, was steeper on the sides than dry dirt would
have been. It reached just beyond the grave on every
side, and was about five and a half feet high, or as high
as it could be conveniently piled.</p>

<p>"So far, all was plain enough; but now another
question presented itself that puzzled me not a little;
and that was, What became of the house? That there
had been one, the arrangement of the numerous post
holes plainly showed; but the large earth mound
above the tumulus or grave was perfectly solid above
the original surface, giving not the slightest evidence
that the posts or any part of the house had ever reached
up into it. I incline to the opinion that the great
fire near the middle of the house had been made from
the timbers composing it; that the upper timbers had
been torn down, and the posts cut off at the surface,
the whole being a kind of votive offering to the dead.
At any rate, it is plain that a house stood there until
<a name="Page_10610" id="Page_10610"></a>the time the mound was built; and it was not there
afterward.</p>

<p>"For the purpose of covering the grave, sand was
brought from a ridge a short distance away. There
was no stratification, either horizontal or curving.
Earth had been piled up first around the black mass
forming the grave mound, and then different parties
had deposited their loads at convenient places, until
the mound assumed its final conical arrangement. The
lenticular masses through almost the whole mound
showed that the earth had been carried in skins or
small baskets. The completed mound was thirteen
feet high, and about one hundred feet in diameter.</p>

<p>"Two and a half feet above the original surface was
an extended skeleton, head west. It lay just east of the
black earth over the grave. Sixteen feet south of the
grave, on the original surface, and within the outer
row of post holes, were two skeletons extended, heads
nearly west. It would seem that the flesh was removed
before burial, as the bones were covered with a dull
red substance, which showed a waxy texture when
worked with a knife blade.</p>

<p>"No relics of any description were found with any of
the skeletons; but a fine copper bracelet was picked
up in a position that showed it was dropped accidentally."</p>

A CHINESE IMPERIAL CEMETERY.</h2>

<p class="center">By Lieut. Hon. <span class="smcap">H. N. Shore, R.N.</span></p>

<p>Some ten miles north of Peking, in a valley where
silence reigns supreme, is situated one of the most remarkable
and imposing burial grounds in the world.
Here, nestling along the slopes of the inclosing mountains,
which form a natural amphitheater, are a series
of vast mausoleums where lie buried the emperors of
the last Chinese dynasty. This was the celebrated
Ming dynasty, which continued from 1366 till 1644,
when, after a sanguinary struggle lasting for twenty-seven
years, it succumbed to the Manchu Tartars, who,
under the title of the Tsin dynasty, have occupied the
throne to the present time.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="./images/image15.png" width="600" height="249" alt="THE AVENUE." title="" /><br />
<span class="caption">THE AVENUE.</span>
</div>

<p>It has been very truly remarked of the Chinese that
they have probably expended more labor over their
public works than any other nation of antiquity; and
assuredly when any great national work is undertaken,
however rare the occurrence, it is invariably carried
out on a scale of unparalleled magnificence. It was,
therefore, only fitting that the tombs containing the
emperors of their own native dynasty should be constructed
on a scale commensurate with the wealth and
extent of the empire whose destinies they swayed for
nigh 300 years. The valley contains altogether thirty
tombs, each of which stands in the center of a wooded
inclosure several acres in extent, surrounded by a high
wall, with an imposing gateway. The largest and
most celebrated is that of Yen-wang, whose body reposes
in a lofty building resting on an immense brick
mound pierced by a slanting tunnel, whose curious
acoustic properties entitle it to be ranked as a "whispering
gallery." In front of the mausoleum is a hall
measuring 220 ft. long by over 90 ft. broad, which contains
the emperor&#39;s tablet. The roof of this building
is supported in the center by thirty-two pillars, composed
of single trees 60 ft. high and over 11 ft. in circumference,
which are said to have been brought from
Corea. The transport of these enormous blocks must
have been a work of no ordinary difficulty, more
especially in the absence of good roads. According to
the description of a missionary who recently witnessed
the moving of a somewhat similar object, it would
seem that the Chinese followed the practice of the
ancient Egyptians, as depicted on their tombs, and in
a country where labor is abundant such a method
would be natural.</p>

<p>An inscription near the entrance states that this
tomb, among others, was repaired by the Emperor
Kienlung, who reigned in the early part of last century;
but like every other ancient building in China
at the present day, it is fast going to ruin for the want
of ordinary care, large trees being permitted to grow
out of the very roof itself, although there are several
attendants residing in the inclosure; while, doubtless,
certain officials are entrusted with the care of this
splendid mausoleum, and draw their salaries regularly.
But <i>laisser faire</i> is the order of the day everywhere in
the neighborhood of Peking, and nothing is ever repaired
nowadays by any chance.</p>

<span class="caption">THE ROAD TO PEKING.</span>
</div>

<p>A part of the original scheme, which shows the magnificent
scale on which the whole thing was planned
and executed, was a fine paved road, carried over
streams and rivers by marble bridges and extending
the whole way from Peking, a distance of ten miles.
On approaching the valley where the tombs repose the
road passes under three handsome "pailaus," or gateways,
and then through one of the most imposing avenues
that was ever constructed. This avenue, which
extends for about two-thirds of a mile, is flanked on
either side with colossal stone figures at intervals of
about 50 yards, representing men and animals in the
following order: Six men, apparently warriors and
priests, in pairs, standing; four horses, four griffins,
four elephants, four camels, and four lions, the first
pair in each set standing, the second recumbent. As
the Chinese have never achieved any great distinction
in the art of sculpture, the representations of animal
life are, needless to say, somewhat caricatured. But
the conception of the whole was magnificent, and the
effect of this long avenue of colossal figures standing in
silent grandeur is as impressive as anything that ever
emanated from the genius of the Chinese race.&mdash;<i>Ill.

<h2><a name="art13" id="art13"></a>
DYSPEPSIA: ITS CAUSES AND PREVENTION.</h2>

<p>Dyspepsia has once been called the "American sickness,"
and although this may be a slander against
which many of the inhabitants of our great republic
might protest, bad digestion is a disease frequent
enough among us to justify us in considering its causes
and in ascertaining by what means this curse of modern
civilization may be avoided. A Frenchman, under
the title "La dyspepsie des gens d&#39;esprit," in the Paris
<i>Revue Scientifique</i> of August 18, shows how utterly
disregarded are the sanitary rules at the dinners of well
bred people in France; and an American lady in a
recent edition of a well known New York daily
humoristically enlarges upon the offenses committed
against health by persons of her own sex while dining
in the largest city of the United States. Speaking of
the lunch of shop girls up town, the contributor to the
American paper deprecates the fact that the young
American girls employed in business houses at luncheon
time live almost entirely on sweets and food that renders
little or no nourishment, rather than procuring
at the same cost a repast which, though perhaps less
dainty, would be far better for their constitution. "Left
to herself," the writer says, "Miss Saleslady, pretty and
refined though she may be, day after day and day
after day keeps her temper, and waits on her customers,
leaning on a slim luncheon of pie and tea. &#39;It is sweet
and nice,&#39; pleaded one girl to me the other day, &#39;and it
goes so much further than anything else.&#39;</p>

<p>"&#39;Not further than bread and milk&#39; I urged, &#39;and
it is surely not half as good for your complexion.&#39;</p>

<p>"&#39;Oh, but the other ladies would laugh at me well if
they saw me eating bread and milk for my luncheon. I
think myself a bit of something light and nice, like
eclairs or a charlotte russe, is ever so much more ladylike
and nice.&#39;</p>

<p>"Heaven save the mark! What sort of flesh and blood
do they make to put on the slender bones of a growing
girl? How will they stand by her, when perhaps she
leaves the shop and chooses the life of wife and
mother? The answer is easy. When the pie-eating,
cooky-feeding girl gets married, put it down in your
note book: One more dyspeptic, peevish woman entered
the lists of the unlovely."</p>

<p>The contributor to the French review, although also
condemning the careless choice of food, more especially
points out the evil consequences of eating too hastily;
and though M. Julva directs his attack chiefly against
the <i>gens d&#39;esprit</i>, <i>i.e.</i>, the well bred people of France
who neglect the rules of health for politeness&#39; sake, his
words apply equally well to the American business
man who sacrifices his health during luncheon to the
"almighty dollar."</p>

<p>"The feverish activity of modern life," he says, "induces
many people to abridge the duration of their
repast, and, particularly, luncheon is taken too hastily&mdash;a
practice the danger of which, as a cause of dyspepsia,
cannot be overrated."</p>

<p>This practice might not be so dangerous if, during the
short time which we dedicate to our midday meal, we
would at least imitate the habit of the Japanese, whom
politeness requires to be absolutely silent while eating.
When they like a certain dish, they express their satisfaction
by graceful gestures addressed to their host,
but they think it would offend him if they open their
mouth for anything else except eating.</p>

<p>Watch, on the other hand, one of our lawyers at
luncheon. He has just dismissed his last client, at the
moment when he should be already at court, and in
order not to be too late he has to lunch in double quick
time. He has to eat his viands without having time
to masticate them, and he swallows his big pieces,
washing them down with several glasses of wine and
water, and hastens to his carriage almost without giving
himself time to breathe, in order not to miss his
call.</p>

<p>Look at a Parisian dining in town. French politeness
forbids him to be silent like the Japanese, and also
requires of him not to speak with his mouth full of food.
And if this were not enough, French gallantry commands
him to serve the ladies first, so that just about
when they have finished, he may commence to eat.
In addition to this, if he does not want to appear ill
bred, he must reply to all their questions, which he
would not be able to do if he did not gulp down his
morsels unchewed. What wonder, then, that most
men have to suffer from eating dinner in such a manner,
while all discomfort could be avoided, if the
viands were served to one guest after the other in succession?</p>

<p>We don&#39;t want to exaggerate. There are privileged
stomachs which can stand all that. But there are
many to which half-masticated food is a real poison.</p>

<p>The unconscious dyspeptic constitutes an extremely
frequent variety. Dyspeptics rarely complain of suffering
from the stomach; many of them will even say
to you that their stomach is excellent. But let us
remember the old fable of Menenius Agrippa: The
whole organism suffers when the stomach is ill treated.</p>

<p>Premature calvity (baldness), some eruptions of acne
(pustules of the skin), a slight dyspn&oelig;a (difficulty in
breathing) when mounting stairs, a blush of heat
on the cheeks a quarter of an hour after luncheon, a
violent craving for smoking after the repast, a feeling
of sleepiness, which, however, quickly fades toward
ten o&#39;clock in the evening, little inclination to
work during the first hours after awakening in the
morning, all these symptoms, or any part of them, show
that you have before you a candidate of the disease
known as bloating of the stomach or the gout. According
to the wise enumeration of Moliere, who was evidently
prompted by Renaudot, such a person begins
with bradypepsia (slow digestion), then suffers from
dyspepsia (bad digestion), afterward from apepsia (indigestion),
and later lyentery (a lax or diarrhea in which
food is discharged only half digested), and at the last the
vicious circle is often completed by obesity, uric affections
of the liver or bladder, and all the other diseases
belonging to that class.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, we are still far from the time when
the public will appreciate that "prevention is better
than cure." Perhaps this fundamental principle of
health will be honored during the 20th century. At
present it certainly is not. Meanwhile, those who
have ruined their health by modern city life take
recourse for their cure to a holiday, hasten to places
where they find mineral waters, or try laxatives or
milk diet to improve their condition. They wish <i>to do
something for their health</i> once or twice a year. How
much better, if they had not been <i>acting against their
health all the year round</i>.</p>

<p>It is extremely difficult to teach our people to eat
healthily. You will find no difficulty to persuade them
to take medicine. People have always time to swallow
a pill, but you will certainly have trouble to teach
them to chew with leisure. How many people who
find time every year to spend the season at Vichy will
tell you it is quite impossible for them to spend five
minutes more every day at luncheon time. And nevertheless
they would regain these few minutes a day with
interest, if they would avoid that host of maladies
which will stop them one day in the midst of their
occupations. I have seen a good many of my clients
getting entirely rid of their rheumatic pains and gout
and ceasing to suffer from sleepless nights by observing
the following simple rules.</p>

<p>In order to chew meat conveniently&mdash;and this is one
of the main points&mdash;one must accustom one&#39;s self never
to mix meat and bread in the same mouthful. Take a
small mouthful, chew it about thirty times, then swallow
that part which has been reduced to pulp, and so
on until all has been masticated. In doing this you
will soon find out that roasted and broiled beef or mutton
requires a longer trituration than boiled meats or
stews; you will also perceive that fish is more easily
masticated than meat, and you will finally understand
why certain dyspeptics are forced to limit their food to
fish, eggs, and milk diet. In fact, milk diet serves no
other purpose than to furnish a perfectly digestible
nourishment.</p>

<p>One of the indirect and unforeseen benefits of a careful
mastication is that people gradually become accustomed
to be satisfied with a comparatively small quantity
of food, for as slow chewing is always more or
less tedious, those who observe this rule soon cease to
be great eaters, and also learn quickly to accustom
themselves to another very important rule, viz., to
drink moderately while eating. Two glasses of liquid
will then quite suffice for a person who would drink
four if he ate his viands swallowing them down without
chewing.</p>

<p>Many obese dyspeptics when they once commence to
<a name="Page_10611" id="Page_10611"></a> carefully and to take liquid moderately
while eating lose weight with an astonishing rapidity
and become cured of the bloating of the stomach
without being finally obliged to have recourse to the
rigorous dry diet of Prof. Bouchard.</p>

<p>Wine and water, the French national drink, is an
extremely frequent, and very often misunderstood,
cause of dyspepsia. A good many people would enjoy
excellent health if they were satisfied with pure water,
that favorite drink of the aged. It is quite perplexing
sometimes to see at the same table three neighbors,
drinking at their dinner, the one wine, the other beer,
and the third tea. How much better would it be if
people, instead of choosing their habitual drink according
to the place that they come from, would select
it more with regard to their individual constitution! I
know many who, after having, for fifty years, quietly
ignored the fact, have come to the recognition that
for them, wine, even if diluted with much water, is
absolutely hurtful, and who, by giving it up, and by
taking pure water, tea, or cider, to which Prof. C. attributes
great success in his practice, instead, have got
rid of their ailments almost as if by enchantment.</p>

<p>In conclusion, I should like to say a word with regard
to salt, this panacea of arthritic persons (persons
suffering from arthritis, swelling of the joints, as in
gout).</p>

<p>For many years I have been laboring under the
wrong impression, that salt is placed on the table merely
for the purpose of salting boiled eggs, which the
cook cannot salt in advance. Great mistake! The
wisdom of nations has discovered that there are people
for whom a great quantity of salt is a necessity, and
that there are others who would become ill if they were
to eat viands that are much salted. The salt cellar is
there in order to enable every one to salt his food according
to his own requirements. Many people are
led by their natural instinct to salt their viands in a
proportion to suit them. But there are others, among
them, above all, the well bred persons previously mentioned,
who treat eating with disdain and for whom
the whole attraction of a repast is the charm of conversation,
and to them the idea of having recourse to
the salt cellar never occurs.</p>

<p>Whether salt is needed in order to add acid to the
gastric juice or whether it has an antiseptic action in
the digestive channel, I do not know. Certain, however,
it is, that it possesses very appreciable laxative
qualities, and under its influence those who go to drink
the waters at Wiesbaden often see their intestinal
functions restored to a surprising degree.</p>

<p>It is just as well, however, and even better, to take
one&#39;s <i>Vichy at home</i>, and nothing is more simple than to
use one&#39;s <i>Wiesbaden at home</i>, by using the salt cellar.
The cure may then be completed by distributing over
a whole year the thirty warm baths which have to be
taken during the season at that watering place. The
bath at 40&deg; Celsius is a real boon for arthritic persons.
The warmer it is, whether salt or not, the better it acts
in producing an exuberant perspiration, and the less is
one apt to catch cold when leaving it.</p>

<p>The above by no means exhausts the vast subject of
dyspepsia and arthritis. But without ignoring the
utility of thermal waters, of morning promenades, of
dry frictions and gymnastics, the sufferers should, above
all, be advised to minutely masticate their food, to
limit the amount of liquids at meal time, to use salt,
which will by no means increase their thirst; and in
certain cases to abstain entirely from alcoholic drinks.
Those who observe these rules may with impunity dine
out, although those so-called great dinners, where all
rules of health are left aside, are absolutely baneful for
a great number of the inhabitants of our cities.</p>

<h2><a name="art12" id="art12"></a>
A NEW SURGICAL OPERATION.</h2>

<p>Among the matters of interest which were brought
before the British Medical Association, at the recent
Glasgow meeting, was an account by Mr. Brudenell
Carter of a method which he had devised of opening
the sheath of the optic nerve behind the eye, for the
relief of pressure within this sheath and within the
cavity of the skull. The brain is invested by firm membranes,
which secrete a certain amount of fluid and
are continued down to the eye in the form of a sheath
which surrounds the optic nerve; and, whenever the
pressure within the cavity of the skull is increased, as
by the growth of a brain tumor, or even by excess of
secretion from the membranes themselves, a superabundance
of fluid is apt to find its way down the
nerve sheath to the level of the eye, to subject the
optic nerve to injurious pressure, and, in many cases,
to destroy the sight. It not infrequently happens that
the pressure within the brain cavity may be increased
by temporary or curable causes, which, nevertheless,
continue in action sufficiently long to produce permanent
blindness, even although the patient may, in
other respects, recover. In view of these conditions
it was suggested by Dr. De Wecker, of Paris, sixteen or
seventeen years ago, that it might be possible to open
the optic nerve sheath, and thus not only to relieve the
nerve from pressure and to preserve it from injury, but
also, on account of the position of the eye relatively to
the brain cavity, to drain the latter by gravitation, and
to relieve the brain as well as the eye. Dr. De Wecker
made two endeavors to accomplish this object, but he
tried to feel his way to the optic nerve without the aid
of sight, and to incise the sheath by means of an instrument
carrying a concealed knife, capable of being
projected by means of a spring. The risks of failure,
and, still more, the risks of inflicting irreparable injury
upon the nerve, were such that he only attempted his
operation in two well nigh hopeless cases, and only one
attempt to follow his example has been recorded. Mr.
Carter&#39;s attention was called to the matter last year by
a case in which the diminution of pressure within the
optic nerve sheath was manifestly desirable; and he
devised a method of operating by which the sheath
could be exposed to view, and the object attained with
certainty, under the guidance of sight at every step of
the process.</p>

<p>He read before the Medical Society of London, last
year, an account of the first case in which he operated,
which was successful; and he read an account of three
more cases at Glasgow, in one of which the result was
negative, as far as sight was concerned, while in the
other two the patients were not only quickly restored
to useful vision, in one instance from complete, in the
other from nearly complete, blindness, but were at the
same time relieved or cured of other symptoms, such
as headache and sickness, arising from direct pressure
on the brain. In his paper at Glasgow, Mr. Carter
claimed for the new operation that it could be performed
with certainty and without risk either to life
or to any important structure, and that it afforded a
reasonable prospect of the preservation of sight in
many forms of disease in which it is now habitually or
frequently lost. As in the case of every new operation,
time and further experience of its effects are required
in order to determine the precise limits of its usefulness.</p>

<p>In the discussion which followed the paper, Mr.
Bickerton, of Liverpool, said that, in consequence of
reading the account of Mr. Carter&#39;s first case, he had
himself performed the operation in two instances, in
one of which temporary restoration of sight was followed
by relapse, while in the second the ultimate issue
was favorable.&mdash;<i>London Times</i>.</p>

<h2><a name="art20" id="art20"></a>
PUTZEYS&#39; FLUSHING RESERVOIR.</h2>

<p>Every sewer is more or less exposed to intermissions
in the flow of the water that it leads, and the result is
a diminution in velocity which leads to deposits of
solid material. Hence the necessity of regularly flushing
the sewer with water, which removes from the sides
the substances that have attached themselves thereto,
and which, without such precaution, soon decompose.
In a word, it is necessary that a <i>perfect</i> washing shall
be assured, and this can be done only by heavy rains
or by strong currents of water. As regards rain, that
could not be relied upon; and to have a force of men
specially charged with the service of washing, that
would be too costly, and so recourse has been had to
automatic apparatus.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="./images/image17.png" width="349" height="500" alt="FLUSHING RESERVOIR.
" title="" /><br />
<span class="caption">FLUSHING RESERVOIR.
</span>
</div>


<p>The automatic siphons used for flushing sewers are
characterized in general by the presence, at the base of
the discharge branch, of a fixed or movable receiving
vessel full of water. This vessel has the inconvenience
of breaking the effect of the charge, and the result is
that these apparatus do not render the services that
might be expected from them. Some of these apparatus
have valves, floats, chains, pulleys, and levers.
These are still more defective, since their operation
is delicate. The parts of which they are composed
easily get out of order, and then the reservoir does no
more flushing at all. A good automatic flushing reservoir
must therefore be of the greatest simplicity, and
its parts must be fixed and strong, and the outflow of
the water must be rapid and energetic and directly
from the reservoir into the sewer. In a word, its construction
should be such that there shall be no need of
inspecting it, and that its operation be regular.</p>

<p>The apparatus devised by Mr. E. Putzeys, Director
of Works of the city of Verviers, well fulfills the conditions
of an excellent flushing reservoir with an automatic
siphon. The siphon has a double curve, but may,
however, have different forms according to the various
uses for which it may be employed, such as for flushing
sewers, urinals, closets, etc.</p>

<p>The annexed figure represents the apparatus as arranged
for flushing a sewer. The apparatus operates
as follows: In the bottom of the branch of the siphon,
S, there is always some water, so that, during the filling
of the reservoir by means of the cock seen in the
figure, the air is compressed in the branch S to a degree
that cannot exceed the pressure of an equal height
of water to about double the height of the siphon.
The reservoir therefore can continue to fill without the
water escaping.</p>

<p>The submersion of the small siphon, <i>a</i>, <i>b</i>, <i>c</i>, is less
than that of the principal siphon, S, and it follows
that when the level of the reservoir reaches a height
equal to <i>b</i>, <i>a</i>, a new influx, however small it be,
causes the discharge of a few drops of water from the
auxiliary siphon, <i>a</i>, <i>b</i>, <i>c</i>, which is always full of water.
At this moment the water that it contains can no
longer resist the thrust of the compressed air in the
branch of the siphon, S, and is therefore forced, along
with the compressed air, into the flushing pipe.</p>

<p>By virtue of the principle of communicating vessels,
the water of the reservoir tends to resume its level in
the interior of the apparatus, and it then enters with
such impetuosity that the siphon, whatever be its
dimensions, is primed. The entire reservoir empties
instantaneously, and the water flows to open the
sewer.</p>

<p>From the experiments made at Verviers by the inventor,
it results that, with a pipe 10 inches in diameter,
the emptying of a 175 cubic foot reservoir can be
effected in 30 seconds.</p>

<p>We may remark that with this apparatus we obtain
the maximum of useful effect, seeing that the work developed
is represented by the total head of the water
diminished simply by losses of charge due to friction
in the pipes. In other apparatus the loss of charge is
much less, since the flushing is broken by a receiver.</p>

<p>Putzeys&#39; apparatus, therefore, with a much less discharge
of water, is capable of producing an effect
superior to that of similar apparatus. On account of
its simplicity and plain character, there is no need of
precision in the installation of this apparatus, and
horizontality, even, is not a <i>sine qua non</i> for its perfect
operation.</p>

<p>The siphon is very easily cleaned, and this is a great
advantage, since it permits of utilizing sewage matter
for filling the flushing reservoir.&mdash;<i>Chronique Industrielle.</i></p>

PEPSIN.</h2>

<p class="center">By A. <span class="smcap">Percy Smith</span>, F.I.C., F.C.S., Rugby.</p>

<p>The method usually adopted for estimating the peptonizing
power of pepsina porci consists in dissolving 1
to 2 grains in 8 to 12 ounces of water, to which 40 to 60
minims of hydrochloric acid has been added. 500 to
1,000 grains of hard-boiled white of egg, granulated by
rubbing through a wire sieve, is immersed in the liquid,
and the whole kept at 98&deg; to 130&deg; F. for four hours,
when the undissolved albumen is filtered off through
muslin, and, after partial drying, is weighed to ascertain
the amount dissolved. The variable numbers
above quoted embrace various formul&aelig; recommended
by different experimenters.</p>

<p>This method of analysis is excessively crude and untrustworthy.
When hard-boiled white of egg is kept
in warm water, it absorbs a considerable quantity of
that menstruum, as much as several units per cent.;
consequently, on weighing the residual albumen, you
may find that the weight is greater instead of less than
that with which you started, the gain in weight due to
absorbed water more than counterbalancing the loss
obtaining through solution, as has happened with indifferent
samples of pepsin. Then who shall say when,
by simple air drying, the albumen has regained its former
condition? The enormous quantity of albumen is
foreign to the usual habits of the scientific analyst, and
involves an enormous waste of time in manipulation.</p>

<p>One trial of this method was enough for me. The
first modification I adopted consisted in substituting
for the large quantity of granulated albumen a single
half of the white of an egg in one piece. I likewise arranged
a check experiment in which the pepsin was
omitted, other conditions remaining unaltered. At the
end of four hours the residual pieces of albumen were
placed on blotting paper to remove superfluous moisture,
and weighed. The gain in weight of the albumen
in the check experiment, due to absorbed water, was
calculated into percentage, and the same deducted
from the weights of the other portions which had been
subjected to the action of various pepsins. This, although
an improvement upon the old method, proved
likewise unreliable, because the water absorbed was
not equal in each experiment. The albumen which
was immersed in acidulated water only quickly dried,
superficially, when placed on blotting paper, whereas
that which had been acted on by pepsin was rendered
glutinous and incapable of being dried in this manner.
In fact, one sample weighed considerably more than it
did at starting, even after deducting the allowance for
water absorbed.</p>

<p>I next tried much smaller pieces of albumen, about 1
c.c., in hope that complete solution might ensue, and a
time value be obtained. I soon found, however, that
the solubility does not depend upon the mass, but
upon the surface exposed.</p>

<p>Finally I discarded altogether the use of fresh white
of egg, and had recourse to dry powdered albumen,
prepared by drying in a steam oven and levigation in
a mortar. With this I succeeded in getting accurate
comparisons between the digestive powers of various
pepsins. Albumen in this form dissolves with rapidity,
owing to its state of fine division. Any remaining undissolved
can be filtered off on a counterpoised filter
paper, and heated in a water oven until absolutely dry.
It is, however, unnecessary to do this when two samples
only are compared against each other, nor is it essential
to know the actual weight of albumen employed,
provided it be the same in each experiment. This
is insured by placing some on the naked pan of the
balance (there is no objection to so doing, as it is a dry
gritty powder, and does not adhere to the metal), and
counterpoising by a similar addition to the other pan.</p>

<p>Let the albumen fall on the center of the filtered
liquid, avoiding, if possible, contact with the glass of
the beaker. It soon sinks, and after the lapse of some
time, a simple inspection will show which is dissolving
with the greater rapidity. Agitation assists solution.
Therefore take the two beakers, one in each hand, and
rotate the contents equally. When one sample has
dissolved all the albumen, it is manifestly superior to
the other which has failed to do so in the given time.
If many samples have to be compared, it will be necessary
to start with known quantities of albumen, and
weigh the undissolved residues in the manner above
indicated.</p>

<p>An objection may possibly be raised to this modified
method, viz., that albumen as ingested is not in the
form of a dry powder, and that we ought to copy as
nearly as possible the conditions existing in the
stomach. To this I would reply that it does not matter
in the least, to us, as analysts, what are the conditions
which obtain in the stomach; since there is no
absolute test for pepsin, we can only compare one sample
against another, and that which dissolves the most
albumen in the shortest time is taken to be the best.</p>

<p>Another imperfect method of analysis is that employed
in the examination of malt extracts for diastase,
in which a certain weight of extract ought to dissolve
a certain weight of starch in ten minutes, when if it
does so dissolve it, the extract is a good one; if not, it is
to be condemned. The more correct way is to ascertain
<a name="Page_10612" id="Page_10612"></a>the reducing power on Fehling&#39;s solution, before
and after digestion with an <i>excess</i> of starch, and I intend
to say a few words upon this subject on a future
occasion, when I have ascertained the maximum
amount of diastase existing in the best samples of malt.&mdash;<i>The

SUBTERRANEOUS FLORA AND FAUNA.</h2>

<p class="center">By Dr. <span class="smcap">Otto Zacharias</span>.</p>

<p>It is generally correct to say that air, light and moisture
form the chief conditions necessary for the development
of organic plant or animal life. One of these
conditions, however, namely light, is not of equal importance
with the two others. For modern investigation
and the discoveries made during the progress of
natural sciences have shown that in the depths of the
ocean, where an everlasting darkness reigns, and where
the temperature is extremely low, nevertheless a great
abundance of animal life is to be found, and that there
exist living beings, not only of the lowest organization,
but even fishes and crustaceans of very complicated
structure, all of which thrive without enjoying the
slightest ray of light.</p>

<p>A similar example of animal life in the absence of
light is to be found in the fauna of caves and grottoes.
This was first made known to the world by Austrian
and American naturalists. The well known Adelsberg
grotto in Krain, and the gigantic Mammoth Cave in
Kentucky, furnished much interesting material for a
detailed study of the biological conditions of subterraneous
animal life. It was gradually discovered that in
those dark places there existed not only insects, spiders,
crustaceans, centipedes, worms, and snails, but
also a kind of salamander and fishes. But what gave
special interest to these discoveries was the fact, ascertained
by careful study, that not all of these beings
were gifted with normally developed organs of vision,
but that in some these organs had undergone a retrograde
development, while others were entirely blind.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/image18.png" width="600" height="110" alt="Fig. 1.&mdash;THE SEMI-BLIND SALAMANDER (PROTEUS ANGUINEUS) OF THE
ADELSBERG GROTTO, IN AUSTRIA." title="" /><br />
<span class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 1.&mdash;THE SEMI-BLIND SALAMANDER (PROTEUS ANGUINEUS) OF THE
ADELSBERG GROTTO, IN AUSTRIA.
</span>
</div>

<p>Among the latter, the blind fish of the Mammoth
Cave (<i>Amblyopsis spelacus</i>) is especially remarkable, because
in this being the retrograde development of the
organ of vision is accompanied by the production of
certain ridges of skin on the body which are endowed
with an extreme sensitiveness of touch, and which, according
to a work lately published by Professor Von
Leydig, are composed of little warts in which the
nerve fibers end. Nature, therefore, has in this case
compensated the amblyopsis for his loss of sight by endowing
him with a highly developed organ of feeling.</p>

<p>A similar phenomenon is to be observed in the blind
crab (<i>Cambaras pellucidus</i>), which is also found in the
Mammoth Cave, for in this being, according to Professor
Von Leydig, the little warts on the interior feelers,
which constitute the organ of smell, have also received
an abnormal development.</p>

<p>Better known than the blind fish and the blind
crab of Kentucky is the <i>Proteus anguineus</i>, a kind of
salamander, of a pale rose color, endowed with gills
and found in the Adelsberg grotto in Austria. (Fig. 1.)</p>

<p>This amphibium has an eye which lies very deep in
the body and is almost overgrown by the skin. But
this eye is by no means as developed as the organ of
vision, for instance, of the water salamander (the triton)
or of the so-called axolotl, for it exists only in a
kind of embryonic development, and contains neither
a vitreous humor nor a lens for the refraction of the
rays of light. As, however, the nerve of vision exists,
it is possible that this salamander may be able to discern
in some manner between light and darkness.</p>

<p>The thinking student, when discovering such imperfect
organs of sight, will naturally ask how the eye
of this salamander, which is so useless for its real purpose,
has come into existence, and he will weigh the
comparative value of the two following explanations.
It may be assumed that there existed once in the Adelsberg
grotto a salamander which was absolutely blind,
and in which, in consequence of an innate power of
evolution, an organ of vision of the lowest kind was
gradually formed. But to this assumption the objection
may be raised at once, why nature should have
produced an organ of vision in an animal living in a
grotto, where such an organ is absolutely useless, and
where such a development would be quite as paradoxical
and improbable as, for instance, the development
of fins instead of legs in an animal living on dry land.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/image19.png" width="400" height="185" alt="Fig. 2.&mdash;GROUP OF PYRENOMYCETES, A SPECIES OF

<p class="longcaption"><i>a</i>. Found in the mines of Waldenburg; <i>b</i>. In the brown-coal pits
near Westeregeln; <i>c</i>. In the Dorothea pit at Klausthal.</p>
</div>


<p>On the other hand, one may suppose, and this is the
more probable explanation, that the <i>Proteus anguineus</i>
is descended from a kind of salamander, which possessed
perfectly developed eyes in the beginning, and that the
imperfect organ of vision in the descendants living in
the dark caves is the result of gradual degeneration.
This is the more likely to be true as in many other cases,
also, we find that organs which become useless and cannot
be employed have gradually degenerated.</p>

<p>Our common mole furnishes an example. Its eyes
also have become small and are deeply hidden in the
muscles, although they are by no means as much degenerated
as in the <i>Proteus anguineus</i>, and are still
possessed of a lens and a retina. Their nerve of vision,
however, has become very imperfect, and its connection
with the brain is interrupted, so that the animal for
this reason can have no perception of light. Notwithstanding
the above, however, it is doubtful whether
the degeneration and gradual disappearance of the
visual organ is in all cases the result of their being no
longer employed, since there exists in dark caves a kind
of beetle, the <i>Machaerites</i>, in which species the female
only is blind, while the male has a well developed organ
of sight. In this case it cannot be maintained that
the absence of light has been the cause of the blindness
of the female beetle, because it would have acted
equally upon the male. Nevertheless, no other explanation
can be found for the blindness. The problem,
therefore, is hitherto unsolved.</p>

<p>Of late the investigations of naturalists have been
extended to the animal life existing not only in grottoes
and caves, but also in mines and pits created by the
action of man, and this has led to many interesting
discoveries and remarkable results. A naturalist who
has especially enlarged our knowledge with regard to
the subterraneous fauna and flora is Dr. Robert Schneider,
of Berlin, who made his studies in the coal mines
near Waldenburg and Altwasser, in Silesia, the salt
mines of Stassfurt and the metal mines of Klausthal, in
the Upper Harz Mountains.</p>

</p>
</div>

<p>As regards the subterraneous flora, Dr. Schneider&#39;s
investigations resulted in showing that the plants
which thrive in the dark regions under ground are
those which possess no chlorophyl and are sensitive
to light. Those which vegetate most luxuriantly there
are the <i>fungi</i>, and among them especially the <i>pyrenomycetes,</i>
which are frequent in the waters of mines.
Their general aspect is shown in a 480 times magnified
form in Fig. 2. They resemble fine threads of delicate
structure, and where found are always discovered in
great abundance. Most conspicuous by their shape
and considerable size are the <i>rhizomorph&aelig;</i>, Fig. 3a,
and they are remarkable, not only for their brilliant
phosphorescence, but also for the peculiar fact that
they are only found in places where light does not
enter. These <i>rhizomorph&aelig;</i>, though this is not easily
recognizable from their external appearance, also belong
to the fungi and are often seen in strings of the
length of over a meter and the thickness of a quill,
spreading out in peculiar branches and hanging down
from moist beams in dark places. Sometimes they
grow like seaweed in the water of the mines, and in
this case they give much embarrassment to the miners,
because they are apt to obstruct the channels constructed
for leading off the superfluous water. In the
mines of Freiberg these <i>rhizomorph&aelig;</i> exist in great
abundance, and Humboldt already mentions specimens
of the length of 4&frac12; feet. Miners in Germany call them
<i>zwirn</i> (thread). The student of natural sciences,
when encountering these peculiar forms of vegetation,
will ask in how far they are the product of their surrounding
circumstances (<i>i.e.</i>, of the absence of light or
the presence of moisture), and in order to find a reply
to this question experiments have been made to grow
these <i>rhizomorph&aelig;</i> under different conditions of existence.
These experiments have shown that from
several species of <i>rhizomorph&aelig;</i> other ordinary fungi
can be developed, and that the subterraneous specimens
therefore may be considered a degeneration and
variation of the fungi found above the surface of the
ground.</p>

</div>

<p><a name="Page_10613" id="Page_10613"></a>In Fig. 4<i>b</i> the <i>Himantia villosa</i> is represented, a rhizomorpha
found in the mines of the Upper Harz Mountains,
thus showing another form of this vegetable
growth. Though it is difficult, as above stated, to recognize
by their shape the rhizormorph&aelig; as fungi, the
origin of the peculiar <i>Agaricus myurus</i> of Hoffmann
(Fig. 4<i>a</i>) will be much easier discovered, though a retrograde
development and degeneration has taken
place also in this fungus. It still shows, however, the
elements of a regular toadstool, only that the stem is
much elongated and looks like a thread or a tube,
while the cap is small, and this explains how, by gradual
degeneration, the cap may disappear entirely,
leaving nothing but a stem, as, for instance, in the case
of the <i>Clavaria deflexa</i>, the club fungus, shown in
Fig. 3<i>b</i>.</p>

<p>In connection with the above it may be well to speak
of the fungi constituting the mould which often covers
the roof and the doors in the brown-coal mines of
Halle, specimens of which are shown in Fig. 5.</p>

<span class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 6.&mdash;THE SUN INFUSORIUM
(ACTINOPHRYS).
</span>
</div>

<p>We now come to the animal life in mines and pits.
This is mostly represented, of course, by lower organisms,
as infusoria and worms. Thus, in the slime on
the bottom of the waters in mines, several species of
<i>am&oelig;b&aelig;</i> are found, which consist of microscopically
small animated bodies, continually floating about,
nourishing themselves by absorbing organic matter, possessing
sensation, propagating, etc., and, in fact, having
actually the qualities of real animal nature. Further,
we find in those subterraneous waters a species of
the sun infusorium (<i>Actinophrys</i>), which is especially
frequent in the mines of Klausthal. Fig. 6. shows one
of these peculiar little beings. Also the <i>Stylonychia</i>
(Fig. 7) is a characteristic inhabitant of those places,
and always present there.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 161px;">
<img src="images/image24.png" width="161" height="400" alt="Fig. 7.&mdash;THE RAPACIOUS INFUSORIUM
(STYLONYCHIA)." title="" />
<span class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 7.&mdash;THE RAPACIOUS INFUSORIUM
(STYLONYCHIA).</span>
</div>

<p>It moves with great rapidity in the water by means
of the numerous hairs covering its body, can turn
quickly in any direction, and thus is enabled to catch
suddenly the little beings on which it lives and which
it hunts; for which reason the stylonychia is called the
"rapacious infusorium."</p>

<p>The above are organisms which can be seen only
through the microscope, but the fauna of mines contains
also larger organisms, though they are not found
as regularly and are not as characteristic for those
places as the forms mentioned hitherto. Among these
organisms there are several species of worms, spiders,
gnats, and, above all, crustaceans of the lower class.
The most interesting of the latter is perhaps a variety
of the sand flea (Fig. 8&mdash;<i>Gammarus pulex</i>). The crustacean
found in the pits of mines, which is related to
the sand flea, shows, according to Dr. R. Schneider, a
slight degeneration of the organ of sight, which has
taken place in consequence of its adaptation to the
dark places, in which this variety of the <i>Gammarus
pulex</i> is found, which can make no use of eyes, while
the sand flea possesses them fully developed. Otherwise,
however, the two varieties are almost absolutely
alike, differing only in some details.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 350px;">

" title="" />
<span class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 8.&mdash;THE SAND FLEA (GAMMARUS PULEX).</span>
</div>

<p>From the above the reader will see that "breathing in
the rosy light," as Schiller calls it, is not an absolutely
necessary condition for the existence of organic beings,
but that life exists everywhere, where there is air and
moisture, and a temperature which is not always below
freezing point, though even eternal frost does not exclude
life entirely, as is proved by the existence of the
glacier flea, showing that even in the icy coverings of
the Alps life still is possible. Mephistopheles may
therefore well say:</p>

<h3>IX.</h3>


<p>In the months of April and May, the younger needle-like
leaves of the Scotch pine are occasionally seen to
have assumed a yellow tinge, and on closer examination
this change in color, from green to yellow, is seen
to be due to the development of what look like small
orange colored vesicles standing off from the surface of
the epidermis, and which have in fact burst through
from the interior of the leaf (Fig. 31). Between these
larger orange yellow vesicles the lens shows certain
smaller brownish or almost black specks. Each of the
vesicular swellings is a form of fungus fructification
known as an <i>&AElig;cidium</i>, and each of the smaller specks
is a fungus structure called a <i>Spermogonium</i>, and both
of these bodies are developed from a mycelium in the
tissues of the leaf. I must employ these technical terms,
but will explain them more in detail shortly: the point
to be attended to for the moment is that this fungus in
the leaf has long been known under the name of <i>Peridermium
Pini</i> (var. <i>acicola</i>, <i>i.e</i>., the variety which lives
upon the needle-like leaves).</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/image26.png" width="439" height="450" alt="Fig. 31." title="" />
<p class="longcaption"><ins class="tnote" title="The figure was reversed in the orginal."><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 31.</ins>&mdash;To the right is a pair of leaves of the Scotch pine, with the blister-like
&AElig;cidia <i>a</i>. of Peridermium Pini (var. acicola) projecting from
their tissues: these blisters are orange yellow in color, and contain
spores, as shown in Fig. 33. Between the blisters are the minute
spermogonia, <i>b</i>. To the left is a small branch, killed at a a a by
Peridermium Pini (var. corticola), the blister-like yellow &AElig;cidia of
the fungus being very conspicuous. (Reduced, after Hartig.)
</p></div>


<p>On the younger branches of the Scotch pine, the
Weymouth pine, the Austrian pine, and some others,
there may also be seen in May and June similar but
larger bladder-like orange vesicles (<i>&AElig;cidia</i>) bursting
through the cortex (Fig. 31); and here, again, careful
examination shows the darker smaller <i>Spermogonia</i> in
patches between the <i>&AElig;cidia</i>. These also arise from a
fungus mycelium in the tissues of the cortex, whence the
fungus was named <i>Peridermium Pini</i> (var. <i>corticola</i>).
It is thus seen that the fungus <i>Peridermium Pini</i> was
regarded as a parasite of pines, and that it possessed
two varieties, one inhabiting the leaves and the other
the cortex: the "varieties" were so considered, because
certain trivial differences were found in the minute
structure of the <i>&AElig;cidia</i> and <i>Spermogonia</i>.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 300px;">
<img src="images/image27.png" width="169" height="400" alt="Fig. 32.&mdash;Blisters (&AElig;cidia) of Peridermium Pini (var. corticola)" title="" /><br />

branch of the Scotch pine: some of the &AElig;cidia have already burst
at the apex and scattered their spores, b, b; the others are still intact.
(Natural size, after Hess).
</span>
</div>

<p>If we cut thin vertical sections through a leaf and
one of the smallest <i>&AElig;cidia</i>, and examine the latter
with the microscope, it will be found to consist of a
mass of spores arranged in vertical rows, each row
springing from a branch of the mycelium: the outermost
of these spores&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, those which form a compact
layer close beneath the epidermis&mdash;remain barren, and
serve as a kind of membrane covering the rest (Fig. 33,
<i>p</i>). It is this membrane which protrudes like a blister
from the tissues. The hyph&aelig; of the fungus are seen
running in all directions between the cells of the leaf
tissue, and as they rise up and form the vertical chains
of spores, the pressure gradually forces up the epidermis
of the leaf, bursts it, and the mass of orange yellow
powdery spores protrude to the exterior enveloped in
the aforesaid membrane of contiguous barren spores.
If we examine older <i>&AElig;cidia</i>, it will be found that this
membrane bursts also at length, and the spores escape.</p>

<p>Similar sections across a <i>Spermogonium</i> exhibit a
structure which differs slightly from the above. Here
also the hyph&aelig; in the leaf turn upward, and send delicate
branches in a converging crowd beneath the epidermis;
the latter gives way beneath the pressure, and
the free tips of the hyph&aelig; constrict off very minute
spore-like bodies. These minute bodies are termed
<i>Spermatia</i>, and I shall say no more about them after
remarking that they are quite barren, and that similar
sterile bodies are known to occur in very many of the
fungi belonging to this and other groups.</p>

<p>Sections through the <i>&AElig;cidia</i> and <i>Spermogonia</i> on
the cortex present structures so similar, except in minute
details which could only be explained by lengthy
descriptions and many illustrations, that I shall not
dwell upon them; simply reminding the reader that
the resemblances are so striking that systematic mycologists
have long referred them to a mere variety of
the same fungus.</p>

<p>Now as to the kind and amount of damage caused
by the ravages of these two forms of fungus.</p>

<p>In the leaves, the mycelium is found running between
the cells (Fig. 33, <i>h</i>), and absorbing or destroying
their contents: since the leaves do not fail the first
season, and the mycelium remains living in their tissues
well into the second year, it is generally accepted that
it does very little harm. At the same time, it is evident
that, if very many leaves are being thus taxed by the
fungus, they cannot be supplying the tree with food
materials in such quantities as if the leaves were intact.
However, the fungus is remarkable in this respect&mdash;that
it lives and grows for a year or two in the leaves,
and does not (as so many of its allies do) kill them after
a few weeks. It is also stated that only young pines
are badly attacked by this form: it is rare to find
<i>&AElig;cidia</i> on trees more than twenty years or so old.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 350px;">

Pini (var. acicola)" title="" />
<p class="longcaption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 33.&mdash;Vertical section through a very young &AElig;cidium of Peridermium
Pini (var. acicola), with part of the subjacent tissue of the leaf, h,
the mycelium of the parasitic fungus running between the cells of the
leaf; immediately beneath the epidermis of the leaf, the ends of the
hyph&aelig; give rise to the vertical rows of spores (b), the outermost of
which (p) remain barren, and form the membrane of the blister-like
body. The epidermis is already ruptured at p by the pressure of the
young &AElig;cidium. (After K. Hartig: highly magnified.)
</p></div>

<p>Much more disastrous results can be traced directly
to the action of the mycelium in the cortex. The hyph&aelig;
grow and branch between the green cells of the
true cortex, as well as in the vast tissues beneath, and
even make their way into the medullary rays and resin
canals in the wood, though not very deep. Short
branches of the hyph&aelig; pierce the cells, and consume
their starch and other contents, causing a large outflow
of resin, which soaks into the wood or exudes from the
bark. It is probable that this effusion of turpentine
into the tissues of the wood, cambium, and cortex has
much to do with the drying up of the parts above the
attacked portion of the stem: the tissues shrivel up
and die, the turpentine in the canals slowly sinking
down into the injured region. The drying up would of
course occur if the conducting portions are steeped in
turpentine, preventing the conduction of water from
below.</p>

<p>The mycelium lives for years in the cortex, and may
be found killing the young tissues just formed from
the cambium during the early summer: of course the
annual ring of wood, etc., is here impoverished. If
the mycelium is confined to one side of the stem, a flat
or depressed spreading wound arises; if this extends
all round, the parts above must die.</p>

<p>When fairly thick stems or branches have the mycelium
on one side only, the cambium is injured locally,
and the thickening is of course partial. The annual
rings are formed as usual on the opposite side of the
stem, where the cambium is still intact, or they are
even thicker than usual, because the cambium there
diverts to itself more than the usual share of food substances;
where the mycelium exists, however, the cambium
is destroyed, and no thickening layer is formed.
From this cause arise cancerous malformations which
are very common in pine woods (Fig. 34).</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 300px;">
<img src="images/image29.png" width="300" height="183" alt="Fig. 34.&mdash;Section across an old pine stem in the cancerous region injured

<p class="longcaption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 34.&mdash;Section across an old pine stem in the cancerous region injured
by Peridermium Pini (var. corticola). As shown by the figures, the
stem was fifteen years old when the ravages of the fungus began
to affect the cambium near a. The mycelium, spreading in the cortex
and cambium on all sides, gradually restricted the action of the
latter more and more; at thirty years old, the still sound cambium only
extended half way round the stem&mdash;no wood being developed on the
opposite side. By the time the tree was eighty years old, only the small
area of cambium indicated by the thin line marked 80 was still alive;
and soon afterward the stem was completely &quot;ringed,&quot; and dead,
all the tissues being suffused with resin. (After Hartig.)
</p></div>

<p>Putting everything together, it is not difficult to explain
the symptoms of the disease. The struggle between
the mycelium on the one hand, which tries to
extend all round in the cortex, and the tree itself, on
the other, as it tries to repair the mischief, will end in
the triumph of the fungus as soon as its ravages extend
so far as to cut off the water supply to the parts above:
this will occur as soon as the mycelium extends all
round the cortex, or even sooner if the effusion of turpentine
hastens the blocking up of the channels. This
may take many years to accomplish.</p>

<p>So far, and taking into account the enormous spread
of this disastrous disease, the obvious remedial measures
seem to be, to cut down the diseased trees&mdash;of
course this should be done in the winter, or at least before
the spores come&mdash;and use the timber as best may
be; but we must first see whether such a suggestion
needs modifying, after learning more about the fungus
and its habits. It appears clear, at any rate, however,
that every diseased tree removed means a source of
&AElig;cidiospores the less.</p>

<p><a name="Page_10614" id="Page_10614"></a>Probably every one knows the common groundsel,
which abounds all over Britain and the Continent,
and no doubt many of my readers are acquainted with
other species of the same genus (<i>Senecio</i>) to which the
groundsel belongs, and especially with the ragwort
(<i>Senecio Jacob&aelig;a</i>). It has long been known that the
leaves of these plants, and of several allied species, are
attacked by a fungus, the mycelium of which spreads
in the leaf passages, and gives rise to powdery masses
of orange yellow spores, arranged in vertical rows beneath
the stomata: these powdery masses of spores
burst forth through the epidermis, but are not clothed
by any covering, such as the <i>&AElig;cidia</i> of <i>Peridermium
Pini</i>, for instance. These groups of yellow spores
burst forth in irregular powdery patches, scattered
over the under sides of the leaves in July and August:
toward the end of the summer a slightly different form
of spore, but similarly arranged, springs from the same
mycelium on the same patches. From the differences
in their form, time of appearance, and (as we shall see)
functions, these two kinds of spores have received different
names. Those first produced have numerous
papill&aelig; on them, and were called <i>Uredospores</i>, from
their analogies with the uredospore of the rust of
wheat; the second kind of spore is smooth, and is called
the <i>Teleutospore</i>, also from analogies with the spores produced
in the late summer by the wheat rust. The fungus
which produces these uredospores and teleutospores was
named and has been long distinguished as <i>Coleosporium
Senecionis</i> (Pers.) We are not immediately interested in
the damage done by this parasite to the weeds which it infests, and
at any rate we might well be tempted to rejoice
in its destructive action on these garden pests. It is sufficient
to point out that the influence of the mycelium is
to shorten the lives of the leaves, and to rob the plant of
food material in the way referred to generally in my
last article.</p>

<p>What we are here more directly interested in is the
following. A few years ago Wolff showed that if the
spores from the <i>&AElig;cidia Peridermium Pini</i> (var. <i>acicola</i>)
are sown on the leaf of <i>Senecio</i>, the germinal hyph&aelig;
which grow out from the spores <i>enter the stomata of
the Senecio leaf, and there develop into the fungus
called Coleosporium Senecionis</i>. In other words, the
fungus growing in the cortex of the pine, and that parasitic
on the leaves of the groundsel and its allies, are
one and the same: it spends part of its life on the tree
and the other part on the herb.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 300px;">

<p class="longcaption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 35. A spore of Peridermium Pini germinating. It puts forth the long,
branched germinal hyph&aelig; on the damp surface of a leaf of Senecio,
and one of the branches enters a stoma, and forms a mycelium in the
leaf: after some time, the mycelium gives rise to the uredospores
and teleutospores of Coleosporium Senecionis. (After Tulasne: highly
magnified.)
</p></div>

<p>If I left the matter stated only in this bald manner,
it is probable that few of my readers would believe the
wonder. But, as a matter of fact, this phenomenon,
on the one hand, is by no means a solitary instance,
for we know many of these fungi which require two
host plants in order to complete their life history; and,
on the other hand, several observers of the highest rank
have repeated Wolff&#39;s experiment and found his results
correct. Hartig, for instance, to whose indefatigable
and ingenious researches we owe most that is known of
the disease caused by the <i>Peridermium</i>, has confirmed
Wolff&#39;s results.</p>

<p>It was to the brilliant researches of the late Prof. De
Bary that we owe the first recognition of this remarkable
phenomenon of <i>heter&oelig;cism</i>&mdash;<i>i. e.</i>, the inhabiting
more than one host&mdash;of the fungi. De Bary proved
that the old idea of the farmer, that the rust is very
apt to appear on wheat growing in the neighborhood
of berberry bushes, was no fable; but on the contrary,
that the yellow <i>&AElig;cidium</i> on the berberry is a phase in
the life history of the fungus causing the wheat rust.
Many other cases are now known, <i>e. g.</i>, the <i>&AElig;cidium
abietinum</i>, on the spruce firs in the Alps, passes the other
part of its life on the rhododendrons of the same region.
Another well known example is that of the fungus
<i>Gymnosporangium</i>, which injures the wood of junipers.
Oersted first proved that the other part of its life is
spent on the leaves of certain Rosace&aelig;, and his discovery
has been repeatedly confirmed. I have myself
observed the following confirmation of this. The stems
of the junipers so common in the neighborhood of Silverdale
(near Morecambe Bay) used to be distorted with
<i>Gymnosporangium</i>, and covered with the <i>teleutospores</i>
of this fungus every spring: in July all the hawthorn
hedges in the neighborhood had their leaves covered
with the &AElig;cidium form (formerly called R&oelig;stelia), and
it was quite easy to show that the fungus on the hawthorn
leaves was produced by sowing the <i>Gymnosporangium</i>
spores on them. Many other well established
cases of similar heter&oelig;cism could be quoted.</p>

<p>But we must return to the <i>Peridermium Pini</i>. It
will be remembered that I expressed myself somewhat
cautiously regarding the <i>Peridermium</i> on the leaves
(var. <i>acicola</i>). It appears that there is need for further
investigations into the life history of this form, for it
has been thought more than probable that it is not a
mere variety of the other, but a totally different
species.</p>

<p>Only so lately as 1883, however, Wolff succeeded in
infecting the leaves of <i>Senecio</i> with the spores of <i>Peridermium
Pini</i> (<i>acicola</i>), and developing the <i>Coleosporium,</i>
thus showing that both the varieties belong
to the same fungus.</p>

<p>It will be seen from the foregoing that in the study
of the biological relationships between any one plant
which we happen to value because it produces timber
and any other which grows in the neighborhood there
may be (and there usually is) a series of problems fraught
with interest so deep scientifically, and so important
economically, that one would suppose no efforts would
be spared to investigate them: no doubt it will be
seen as time progresses that what occasionally looks
like apathy with regard to these matters is in reality
only apparent indifference due to want of information.</p>

<p>Returning once more to the particular case in question,
it is obvious that our new knowledge points to
the desirability of keeping the seed beds and nurseries
especially clean from groundsel and weeds of that description:
on the one hand, such weeds are noxious in
themselves, and on the other they harbor the <i>Coleosporium</i>
form of the fungus <i>Peridermium</i> under the
best conditions for infection. It may be added that it
is known that the fungus can go on being reproduced
by the <i>uredospores</i> on the groundsel plants which
live through the winter.</p>
